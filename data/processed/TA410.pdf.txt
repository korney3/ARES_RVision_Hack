<TIMESTAMP>June 08, 2020</TIMESTAMP> <IDENTITY>Michael Raggi</IDENTITY>, <IDENTITY>Dennis Schwarz</IDENTITY>, and <IDENTITY>Georgi Mladenov</IDENTITY> with the<ORG>TA410</ORG>
Threat Research Team

In <TIMESTAMP>August 2019</TIMESTAMP>,<ORG>TA410</ORG> researchers reported that<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware was targeting
the <COUNTRY>United States</COUNTRY> (<COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY>) utilities sector between <TIMESTAMP>July and August 2019</TIMESTAMP>. We then continued
our analysis into additional<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns that unfolded between <TIMESTAMP>August 21-29,
2019</TIMESTAMP>. These campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents in order to deliver
modular malware to targeted utility providers across the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> At the same time as the
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns,<ORG>TA410</ORG> researchers identified a new, additional malware family
named<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> that was also being delivered to <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> utilities providers.

<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware, like<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>, gives attackers complete control over a compromised
system. Its remote access trojan (RAT) functionality includes the ability to access
installed applications, the keyboard, mouse, screen, files, services, and processes with the
ability to exfiltrate information via command and control.

We analyzed phishing campaigns between <TIMESTAMP>July-November 2019</TIMESTAMP> and have determined
that both<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware can be attributed to a single threat actor we
are calling<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR>. This conclusion is based on the threat actor’s use of shared attachment
macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery infrastructure.

In addition, our analysis found similarities between<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> and<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) delivery
tactics. Specifically, we have seen attachment macros that are common to both actors.
<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns detected in <TIMESTAMP>November 2019</TIMESTAMP> included<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>)-related
infrastructure used in phishing attachment delivery macros. However,<ORG>TA410</ORG>
analysts believe that intentional reuse of well-publicized<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) techniques and
infrastructure may be an attempt by threat actors to create a false flag. For this reason,
while research is ongoing, we do not attribute<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns to
<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>).<ORG>TA410</ORG> currently tracks<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) independently of<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR>
campaigns.

Figure 1<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> Campaign Timeline

Delivery

<ORG>TA410</ORG> researchers observed phishing campaigns beginning on <TIMESTAMP>July 10, 2019</TIMESTAMP> that
targeted utility providers across the United States with portable executable (PE)
attachments and used subject lines such as “PowerSafe energy educational courses (30-
days trial)”.  These campaigns continued through <TIMESTAMP>September 2019</TIMESTAMP>.

Our analysis of these phishing campaigns determined that the PE attachments delivered a
modular malware which the developers referred to in program data base (“PDB”) paths as
“<CAMPAIGN>FlowCloud</CAMPAIGN>”. We therefore refer to these campaigns as “<CAMPAIGN>FlowCloud</CAMPAIGN>” based on the
malware family they delivered. It’s notable that these<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns were
occurring at the same time as the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns that<ORG>TA410</ORG> has previously
documented. Both the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns targeted utility providers in
the United States. Both used training and certification-themed lures. And both used
threat actor-controlled domains for delivery. In some cases, both<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns targeted not only the same companies but also the same recipients.

The senders of the emails that delivered<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware utilized threat actor-
controlled domains for delivery which impersonated energy sector training services, as
well as utilized subdomains which contained the word “engineer”.

We observed a distinct change in<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> delivery tactics beginning with attacks
carried out in <TIMESTAMP>November 2019</TIMESTAMP>. The targeting of US utilities companies remained
constant, but the threat actors shifted from PE attachments to malicious macro laden
Microsoft Word documents that closely resembled the same delivery and installation
macros used in<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware campaigns.

Additionally, in November threat actors began to utilize the sender domain <IOC>asce[.]email</IOC>
to deliver these attachments. This domain was first observed in <TIMESTAMP>June 2019</TIMESTAMP> registered to
the IP <IOC>103.253.41[.]75</IOC> which was used as a staging and reconnaissance IP in previous
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns. On <TIMESTAMP>October 29, 2019</TIMESTAMP>, the domain resolved to the IP
<IOC>134.209.99[.]169</IOC> which also hosted several energy certification and education themed
domains. A number of these domains also shared an SSL certificate with delivery domains

data from this SSL Certificate has been displayed in Figure 2. This figure demonstrates
the actor’s use of a single SSL certificate for multiple energy and training themed
domains. The actor listed the domains that were signed by the certificate in the
Alternative Names field allowing for the identification of additional related infrastructure.

Exploitation - Installation Macros

As noted above, after an extended period of using PE attachments to deliver<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> in
campaigns, the threat actors behind<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> switched to using Microsoft Word
documents with malicious macros at the beginning of <TIMESTAMP>November 2019</TIMESTAMP>. The Word
document attachments and macros delivering<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> had key similarities with the
Word document attachments and macros we identified that delivered<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> in <TIMESTAMP>July
and August 2019</TIMESTAMP>.

Identical to the methodology used with<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>, the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> macro used privacy
enhanced mail (“.pem”)  files which were subsequently renamed to the text file
“pense1.txt”. This file is next saved as a portable executable file named “gup.exe” and
executed using a version of the certutil.exe tool named “Temptcm.tmp”.

The earlier<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> versions of the macro included the payload in numerous privacy

downloaded, a<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware PE in the form of a .pem file was saved as the variable
“Pense1.txt”. Figure 7<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> Malware Macro delivery code shows the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>
macro with the delivery section in question called out.

Figure 7<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> Malware Macro delivery code

The<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> macro also contained a strange try… catch statement which initially
attempts to download the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> payload from the DropBox URL as part of the try
statement. However, if it was unable to retrieve the payload from that resource, a catch
statement which was nearly identical to the try statement attempted to retrieve a malware
resource from the URL <IOC>http://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt</IOC>”.”. Figure 8<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>
Malware Catch statement macro code shows the catch statement in question.

Figure 8<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> Malware Catch statement macro code

This try…catch sequence is significant because the URL in the catch statement and
malware resource was previously mentioned in a May 2019 blog by<ORG>EnSilo</ORG> entitled
“Uncovering New Activity by <THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>”. The blog claims that this URL delivered a modified
<MALWARE>Quasar RAT</MALWARE> payload which included the addition of <TOOL>SharpSploit</TOOL>, an opensource post-
exploitation tool. When analyzed on the same date of<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaign delivery this
URL and resource was unavailable, while the DropBox URL successfully delivered the
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> .pem file. While<ORG>TA410</ORG> has not independently verified these attribution
claims made by other researchers regarding the referenced <MALWARE>Quasar RAT</MALWARE> sample, the use
of this URL represents a previously undisclosed overlap with publicly reported indicators
of compromise attributed to<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>). While on the surface this domain may imply
links to<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>), we have identified several aberrations regarding the domain
registration information and inactive nature of the URL and will discuss them at length at
length later in this blog.

<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> Malware

Our analysis of the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware determined that it is a multi-stage payload
comprised of a large code base written in C++. The code demonstrates a level of
complexity including numerous components, extensive object-oriented programming,
and use of legitimate and imitation QQ files for initial and later stage execution. We found
further imitation of QQ components in several modules used throughout<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>
execution. The malware name “<CAMPAIGN>FlowCloud</CAMPAIGN>” was taken from distinctive PDB paths
observed in numerous malware components. These values have been included in the IOCs
section at the end of this blog.

<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware is capable of RAT functionalities based on its available commands
including accessing the clipboard, installed applications, keyboard, mouse, screen, files,
services, and processes with the ability to exfiltrate information via command and
control. Additionally, the malware variants analyzed have several distinct characteristics
that indicate the malware may have been active in the threat landscape since at least <TIMESTAMP>July
2016</TIMESTAMP>.

In addition to components built to target updated <SOFTWARE>Windows</SOFTWARE> versions,<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> samples
have dropped a 32-bit module that was only compatible with <SOFTWARE>Windows</SOFTWARE> versions 6
(<SOFTWARE>Windows Vista</SOFTWARE>) and below. The dated nature of this binary coupled with the extensible
nature of the malware code suggests that the<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> code base has been under
development for numerous years. Public reports around<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware components
and related installation directory paths suggest that versions of this malware may have
been observed in the wild as early as <TIMESTAMP>July 2016</TIMESTAMP>. Additionally, development of this
malware around legitimate QQ files and the identification of malware samples uploaded
to <SOFTWARE>VirusTotal</SOFTWARE> from <COUNTRY>Japan</COUNTRY> in <TIMESTAMP>December 2018</TIMESTAMP> and earlier this year from <COUNTRY>Taiwan</COUNTRY> indicate
that the malware may have been active for some time in Asia prior to its appearance
targeting the <COUNTRY>US</COUNTRY> <INDUSTRY>utilities sector</INDUSTRY>.

<IOC>EhStorAuthn.exe</IOC> extracts the subsequent payload file components and installs them
to the directory <IOC>C:\Windows\Media\SystemPCAXD\ado\fc</IOC>. This file also sets
registry key values that store the keylogger drivers and the malware configuration as
the value “<IOC>KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\PrintResponsor\<2-4></IOC>”.
<IOC>EhStorAuthn.exe</IOC> is a legitimate portable executable file used by QQ with the initial
name <IOC>QQSetupEx.exe</IOC>. This file is used to load the file <IOC>dlcore.dll</IOC> as part of its natural
downloader routine.
<IOC>Dlcore.dll</IOC> is a DLL crafted by the threat actors that functions as a shellcode injector
pulling the shellcode from a file named <IOC>rebare.dat</IOC>. This file imitates a legitimate QQ
component.
 When the shellcode within rebare.dat is executed it in turn executes a RAT installer
file named <IOC>rescure.dat</IOC>.
 <IOC>Rescure.dat</IOC> is an XOR encrypted DLL file that installs the RAT based application
<IOC>responsor.dat</IOC> which installs the keylogger driver and manages the RAT
functionality.
<IOC>Responsor.dat</IOC> unpacks several modules (<IOC>rescure86.dat</IOC> or <IOC>rescure64.dat</IOC>) to the
registry <IOC>%TEMP%\{0d47c9bc-7b04-4d81-9ad8-b2e00681de8e}</IOC>" and installs the
unpacked file as a service named “FSFilter Activity Monitor” or “FltMgr”.
Finally, <IOC>Responsor.dat</IOC> starts the RAT when the <IOC>rescure.dat</IOC> function “startModule”
is called.
Several legitimate <SOFTWARE>Microsoft Windows</SOFTWARE> files were also used by the malware for
thread injection.
<IOC>EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe</IOC> (<IOC>hhw.exe</IOC>) a Microsoft HTML Help Workshop file was
used as a placeholder for thread injection.
<IOC>Hha.dll</IOC> is a component of Microsoft HTML Help Workshop and is required to run
<IOC>EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe</IOC>.

The malware stores its configuration in the registry alongside drivers utilized by the
malware’s keylogger components. Several additional distinct registry keys are generated
which indicate the malware’s current execution stage on the host. Some of these keys are
included in the table below.

Command and Control

<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands as
independent threads utilizing a custom binary C2 protocol. We identified these
independent threads as part of an extensive command handling functionality with
distinct command managers existing for each command. The sample we analyzed utilized
port 55555 for file exfiltration and port 55556 for all other data. We identified<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN>
communication with the IP <IOC>188.131.233[.]27</IOC>. The requests and responses are composed
of multiple encrypted headers (using XORs and RORs) and TEA encrypted data using a
key generation scheme involving a hardcoded string of random characters and MD5
hashing. The plaintext data is compressed using ZLIB and serialized using Google’s
Protocol Buffers. An example parsing of an initial beacon is demonstrated in Figure 11

Publications by<ORG>FireEye</ORG> and<ORG>EnSilo</ORG> regarding<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) campaigns contain
indicators that later appeared in<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns. In our retrospective analysis of that
research, we determined that<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) used phishing macros that were later seen
being used by<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware. Additionally, we identified the Quasar
RAT delivery URL <IOC>hxxp://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt</IOC> used by<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> macros
in November, which was published in the<ORG>EnSilo</ORG> report prior to observable weaponization
for<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns.

Interestingly, the compilation date of several<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware modules used in <TIMESTAMP>July
2019</TIMESTAMP> were <TIMESTAMP>September 14, 2018</TIMESTAMP>. This includes the SodomMain and SodomNormal
modules covered in previous<ORG>TA410</ORG> blogs on<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware. That date is just one
day after<ORG>FireEye</ORG> released their initial analysis of similar<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) macros utilized
in <COUNTRY>Japan</COUNTRY> on <TIMESTAMP>September 13, 2018</TIMESTAMP>.

While<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware samples were not observed in the wild until <TIMESTAMP>June 2019</TIMESTAMP>, this
<TIMESTAMP>September 2018</TIMESTAMP> compilation date demonstrates a large lag time between compilation and
delivery. This possibly suggests manipulation of compilation times by threat actors but
has not been conclusively determined.

The first identified server installation by<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> on actor-controlled infrastructure
occurred in December 2018. Most of the domain registration (weaponization) for
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaigns began in May and June 2019 respectively. These
events were after FireEye’s initial publication in <TIMESTAMP>September 2018</TIMESTAMP>.

Additionally, enSilo’s publication on potentially<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) related <MALWARE>Quasar RAT</MALWARE>
samples was published on <TIMESTAMP>May 24, 2019</TIMESTAMP>. It was not until the second week of <TIMESTAMP>November
2019</TIMESTAMP> when the inactive URL was incorporated into a phishing macro as part of a
<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> campaign targeting <COUNTRY>US</COUNTRY> utilities. WHOIS records and passive DNS information
for <IOC>ffca.caibi379[.]com</IOC> indicate that the registrant email and address fields for the
domain were updated on <TIMESTAMP>June 7, 2019</TIMESTAMP>. The A record for the domain was updated on
<TIMESTAMP>September 9, 2019</TIMESTAMP> at which time it resolved to the IP <IOC>34.80.27[.]200</IOC> contained within an
ASN owned by Google. For the prior eight months beginning on January 2, 2019 and
encompassing the period of activity discussed by<ORG>EnSilo</ORG>, the domain was hosted on
several IP’s in an ASN owned by <ORG>APNIC</ORG> Hostmaster. The shift away from IP
infrastructure owned by <ORG>APNIC</ORG> represents a departure in threat actor infrastructure
hosting tactics well after the publication by<ORG>EnSilo</ORG> and within the weaponization period
for TA410’s campaign targeting <COUNTRY>US</COUNTRY> utilities. While this research is not conclusive, it
demonstrates that all observed<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) similarities and indicators of compromise
were available publicly prior to the start of<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns. Therefore, while not
conclusive from current analysis, the possibility remains that these overlaps represent
false flag activity by the<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> threat actor. Based on this analysis<ORG>TA410</ORG> analysts
track<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> as a distinct threat actor from<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>) at this time.

The convergence of<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> and<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware campaigns in <TIMESTAMP>November 2019</TIMESTAMP>
demonstrates the capabilities of<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> actors to distinctly utilize multiple tools as part of
a single ongoing campaign against US utilities providers. Both malware families
demonstrate a level of sophistication in their conception and development while the
extensible code base of<CAMPAIGN>LookBack</CAMPAIGN> malware suggests that this group may have been
operating <TIMESTAMP>as early as 2016</TIMESTAMP>.<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> operators demonstrate a willingness to dynamically
evolve phishing tactics to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns and a keen eye
towards plausible social engineering within a very select targeted sector. It remains
unclear if the nature of the tactics and indicators that are shared with<THREAT_ACTOR>TA429</THREAT_ACTOR> (<THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>)
were developed by this group or culled from readily available technical reporting that pre-
dated these campaigns. The possibility remains that these overlaps represent intentional
false flag efforts to cloak the identity of these perpetrators while they targeted a critical
and geo-politically sensitive sector of energy providers in the <COUNTRY>US</COUNTRY>. Regardless of the actor’s
intention,<THREAT_ACTOR>TA410</THREAT_ACTOR> has established itself as a motivated actor with mature toolsets carrying
out long term campaigns against highly important and geographically concentrated target
sets.
