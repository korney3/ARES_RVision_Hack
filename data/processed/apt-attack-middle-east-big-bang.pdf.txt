<THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR> Attack In the <COUNTRY>Middle East</COUNTRY>: <CAMPAIGN>The Big Bang</CAMPAIGN>
<TIMESTAMP>July 8, 2018</TIMESTAMP>

<TIMESTAMP>Over the last few weeks</TIMESTAMP>, the <ORG>Check Point Threat Intelligence Team</ORG> discovered the comeback of an <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR>

surveillance attack against institutions across the <COUNTRY>Middle East</COUNTRY>, specifically the <ORG>Palestinian Authority</ORG>.

The attack begins with a phishing email sent to targets that includes an attachment of a self-extracting

archive containing two files: a <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> document and a malicious executable. Posing to be from the

<ORG>Palestinian Political and National Guidance Commission</ORG>, the <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> document serves as a decoy,

distracting victims while the malware is installed in the background.

The malware has several modules, some of which are:

Taking a screenshot of the infected machine and sending it to the C&C server.

Sending a list of documents with file extensions including .doc, .odt, .xls, .ppt, .pdf and more.

Logging details about the system.

Rebooting the system.

Self-destructing the executable.

While it is not clear exactly what the attacker is looking for, what is clear is that once he finds it, a second

stage of the attack awaits, fetching additional modules and/or malware from the Command and Control

server. This then is a surveillance attack in progress and has been dubbed ‘<CAMPAIGN>Big Bang</CAMPAIGN>’ due to the

attacker’s fondness for the ‘Big Bang Theory’ TV show, after which some of the malware’s modules are

named.

A previous campaign of this <THREAT_ACTOR>APT group</THREAT_ACTOR> was uncovered by <ORG>Talos</ORG> in <TIMESTAMP>June 2017</TIMESTAMP>, and since then very little of

this operation was seen in the wild. The <CAMPAIGN>Big Bang</CAMPAIGN> campaign described below incorporates improved

capabilities and offensive infrastructure, and seems to be even more targeted.

 

What’s New in <COUNTRY>Ramallah</COUNTRY>?

The first instances of the current campaign began to appear <TIMESTAMP>in the middle of April this year</TIMESTAMP>. But, thanks to

the attackers known affection for decoy documents that pose as news summaries, we were able to date

the campaign back to <TIMESTAMP>March 2018</TIMESTAMP>.

This campaign, as well as those in its previous form, uses phishing methods to deliver its reconnaissance

stage malware. But unlike in <TIMESTAMP>2017</TIMESTAMP>, this time the malicious attachment is an executable which is actually a

self-extracting archive, containing a decoy document and the malware itself. It is almost superfluous to

mention that in order to give the file a legitimate look, the developers pinned it to a <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> icon and called

it “ا������ ا����� ا����ي” (Monthly Press Report).

When this file is double clicked, it opens a <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> document with the logo of the <ORG>Palestinian Political and National Guidance Commission</ORG>. This document pretends to be a press report and contains news

headlines that were actually copied from various Palestinian news websites.

While the victim is distracted with the legitimate looking <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> document, an additional executable which

is archived alongside the decoy document is installed in the background.

Figure 1: Screenshot of <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> Document.

Although the archive was found on <TIMESTAMP>mid-April</TIMESTAMP>, the <SOFTWARE>Word</SOFTWARE> document shows that it was last edited on <TIMESTAMP>March 29 , 2018</TIMESTAMP>. This date is also mentioned in the document’s body and used as its title, “<IOC>29-3.doc</IOC>”. The

metadata in the document shows that it was also titled “���� دة ا����� /���م أ�����”, which happens to be the
name of the <ORG>Guidance Commission Office</ORG>’s Chief Executive:

The naming convention and content of the file may indicate an attacker’s familiarity with the nature of the

victim.

 

Analysis

While the analysis below discloses the capabilities of the spotted malware, we are pretty sure it is part of

a multi-staged attack that targets very specific victims. The malware below is part of the reconnaissance

stage and should lead to the main course, whose nature is still unknown.

As for the malware’s language, <TIMESTAMP>during the 2017</TIMESTAMP> campaign the group used a fairly unsophisticated

malware, dubbed “<MALWARE>Micropsia</MALWARE>”, written in <SOFTWARE>C++</SOFTWARE> and wrapped in <SOFTWARE>Delphi</SOFTWARE>. In this year’s campaign, the

attackers use an upgraded variant of this malware, still written in <SOFTWARE>C++</SOFTWARE> but wrapped as a self-extracting

executable.

 

The Executable

The executable contained in the archive is called “<IOC>DriverInstallerU.exe</IOC>” but its metadata shows that its

original name is “<IOC>Interenet Assistant.exe</IOC>”.

Once it is executed, the malware ensures its persistence by setting a mutex (“InterenetAssistantN”),

copying itself to the “ProgramData” directory, and adding itself to the scheduled tasks.

Once secured, the malware communicates, by default, with a primary hardcoded command and control

website that varies in different samples (<IOC>spgbotup[.]club</IOC>). The <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR> actors, hardcoded additional backup

C&C website (<IOC>lindamullins[.]info</IOC>) that is contacted in case the malware does not get a response from the

first website. This is likely to be a mechanism that the threat actors implemented in order to handle

cases in which they would have to go through infrastructure changes.

Once the sample is able to reach the main C&C, the first thing it does is fingerprint the system (user and

PC names, OS version and AntiVirus engines), and exfiltrate the gathered information.

Figure 4: Initial Beacon.

Following this, a POST request is sent to the C&C every once in a while

(/api/serv/requests/[base64_fingerprint]), and in turn, the C&C sends back a configuration file that turns

on specific functionalities of the malware.

 

 

 

Figure 5: C&C Commands

What is interesting is that each key in this configuration file represents a different module in the

executable, and when the key is marked as true the executable will run the relevant module’s content. In

addition, the names of those modules are taken from the popular sitcom, ‘The Big Bang Theory’, in

addition to actors’ names from the popular Turkish TV series ‘Resurrection: Ertugrul’ (<IDENTITY>Celal Al</IDENTITY>, <IDENTITY>Sonmez</IDENTITY>
and <IDENTITY>Gokhan</IDENTITY>).

In the configuration file we found thirteen keys for thirteen different modules. However, in our samples

we could find only five corresponding modules. This could mean that this campaign is evolving and that

there will likely be more samples in the future that will implement the missing parts.

The following table describes the role of each module:

Module Name Purpose

<MALWARE>Penny</MALWARE> Takes a screenshot of the infected machine and sends it to the server

<MALWARE>Wolowitz_Helberg</MALWARE>
Enumerates running processes, saves their names and their IDs in

“<IOC>sat.txt</IOC>” and sends the file to the server

https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fig-4.png


<MALWARE>Celal_Al</MALWARE> Sends a list of documents with certain extensions. The extensions are:

doc, docx, odt, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, accdb, accde, mdb, pdf, csv

<MALWARE>Runfile</MALWARE> Runs a file, receives a process name and a file type from the server

<MALWARE>Nayyar_Sonmez</MALWARE>
Downloads a file with a ‘.txt’ extension from a given URL, changes the

extension to ‘.exe’ and runs it

<MALWARE>Koothrappali</MALWARE> Logs details about the system and sends them to the server

<MALWARE>Bialik_Gokhan</MALWARE> Reboots the system

<MALWARE>Hofstadter</MALWARE> Terminates a process by name

<MALWARE>Parsons_Sheldon</MALWARE> Deletes the payload from the startup folder and deletes the actual file

<MALWARE>Reshad_Strik</MALWARE> Sends a list of the partitions found on the infected machine

<MALWARE>Pinar8</MALWARE> No such module in our sample

<MALWARE>Mehmet7</MALWARE> No such module in our sample

<MALWARE>Bahar6</MALWARE> No such module in our sample

It is important to note that unlike <MALWARE>RATs</MALWARE> that try to keylog the infected system and harvest credentials, this

sample shows the irregular behavior of looking for <SOFTWARE>Microsoft Office</SOFTWARE> documents on the victim’s machine,

or enumerating partitions. In addition, the file has the capability of downloading and running another

executable

After reviewing all the malware functionalities, we are confident in saying that the attackers look for

victims who answer well-defined characteristics and believe that further stages of the attack are

delivered only to those who fit the specific victim profile.

 

The Attacker’s English Level

The typo in the file’s name (<IOC>Interenet Assistant</IOC>) helped us find another executable with the same name

that is almost identical to the original one. In addition, using the communication pattern we were able to

find another sample called “<IOC>DriverInstallerU</IOC>”. In this sample, however, the module names were changed

from actors and characters’ names to car models, namely “<MALWARE>BMW_x1</MALWARE>”, “<MALWARE>BMW_x2</MALWARE>” and up to “<MALWARE>BMW_x8</MALWARE>”.

But typos are not the only English mistakes of this <THREAT_ACTOR>APT group</THREAT_ACTOR>. Incorrect grammar phrases in the C2

websites also assisted in uncovering the operation infrastructure.



Unlike what is generally expected from a C&C, browsing the websites actually returns the following

response:

Websites related to this campaign use readymade bootstrap templates, but include unique and

grammatically incorrect strings such as “Probably the most Music Site in the world!”, and

“<IOC>contact@namylufy[.]com</IOC>” in some of the websites.

Those strings helped us find other websites that use the same template, and while they could not be

linked to specific malware samples, it is possible that they will be used in the future.

 

Looking Back

While the <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR> has gone through significant upgrades <TIMESTAMP>over the past year</TIMESTAMP>, the conductors of these

campaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware development

conventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to past attacks, and may

also have some resemblance to attacks related to the <THREAT_ACTOR>Gaza Cybergang</THREAT_ACTOR> <THREAT_ACTOR>APT group</THREAT_ACTOR>.

During our investigation we spotted three instances of the renewed operation, but unique artifacts in the

command and control website revealed a wider infrastructure that may well manage more unknown

samples.

In addition, the concept of using self-extracting archives and decoy documents is not groundbreaking or

new, as we have seen similar attacks being carried in the past by the <THREAT_ACTOR>Gaza Cybergang</THREAT_ACTOR> <THREAT_ACTOR>APT group</THREAT_ACTOR>.

There were, however, many similarities between the samples we found and the ones which were found

<TIMESTAMP>during the 2017</TIMESTAMP> campaign, such as the usage of actor and character names from renowned TV series, as

well as fingerprinting the system and sending the information to the C&C. According to <ORG>Talos</ORG>, those files

were distributed to victims in the Palestinian law enforcement agencies <TIMESTAMP>during 2017</TIMESTAMP>.

However, in <TIMESTAMP>2017</TIMESTAMP> the group used an executable wrapped in Delphi, whereas the sample we found uses a

self-extracting archive. Both of the above open a document as well as another executable (written in <SOFTWARE>C++</SOFTWARE>)

when they are double clicked.

Finally, the C&C communication has also been improved in the recent campaign, as backup domains did

not appear in the old ones. In addition, the newer malware strain has stronger capabilities and a wider

functionality than the older one, which would only send information about the system version.

 

Conclusion

With the experience gained from the <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR> attack that began in <TIMESTAMP>March 2017</TIMESTAMP>, it seems this campaign has

evolved into an attack with new capabilities, and an even more specific target, <TIMESTAMP>over a year later</TIMESTAMP>.

Although the group behind it seems to be focused on carefully selecting their victims, using a custom-

made info-stealer for intelligence gathering operations, due to its very nature it is difficult to assert what

the ultimate goal of this campaign is. Indeed, the next stages of the attack may even still be in the works,

not yet deployed or only deployed to selected few victims.

In addition, although the clear fingerprints of the perpetrators leave no doubt we are witnessing the

comeback of the same <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR>, it is still not yet confirmed exactly who the threat group behind this campaign

actually is. As no concrete attribution has yet been made, due to the shared interests and malware

features of both <TIMESTAMP>2017</TIMESTAMP> and <TIMESTAMP>2018</TIMESTAMP> campaigns, the <THREAT_ACTOR>Gaza Cybergang</THREAT_ACTOR> may be a good starting point for further

research.
