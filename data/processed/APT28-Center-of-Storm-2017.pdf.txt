Appendix 9



The <ORG>Democratic National Committee’s</ORG> (<ORG>DNC</ORG>) June 

2016 announcement attributing its network breach 

to the<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> triggered an international 

debate over Russia’s sponsorship of information 

operations against the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> 

INTRODUCTION

At issue is the question of proof: did the<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> direct the group 
responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter  
of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the <ORG>DNC</ORG> breach part  
of a concerted effort by the<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> to interfere with the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> 
presidential election?

Unfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will 
<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY> continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks,  
to undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> 
perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? 

Our visibility into the operations of<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> - a group we believe the Russian 
Government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government’s  
targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.  
We have tracked and profiled this group through multiple investigations, endpoint 
and network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28’s 
operations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group’s 
malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical 
to protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening  
our confidence in attributing<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> to the<ORG>Russian Government</ORG>.

OVERVIEW

On <TIMESTAMP>December 29, 2016</TIMESTAMP>, the <ORG>Department of Homeland Security</ORG> (<ORG>DHS</ORG>) 
and <ORG>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORG> (<ORG>FBI</ORG>) released a Joint Analysis 
Report confirming FireEye’s long held public assessment that the Russian 
Government sponsors<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>. Since at least 2007,<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> has engaged  
in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests.  
The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and prolific 
set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on 
defense and geopolitical issues.<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> espionage activity has primarily 
targeted entities in the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY>, <COUNTRY>Europe</COUNTRY>, and the countries of the former 
<COUNTRY>Soviet Union</COUNTRY>, including governments and militaries, defense attaches, 
media entities, and dissidents and figures opposed to the current <ORG>Russian 
Government</ORG>.

Over the past two years,<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY> appears to have increasingly leveraged 
<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> to conduct information operations commensurate with broader 
strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization, 
<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political 
narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included  
the conflict in <COUNTRY>Syria</COUNTRY>, <ORG>NATO</ORG>-Ukraine relations, the <COUNTRY>European Union</COUNTRY> refugee 
and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete 
doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored 
hacking, and the 2016 <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> presidential election. 

This report details our observations of APT28’s 
targeting, and our investigation into a related 
breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the 
group’s tool development and use, and summarize 
the tactics<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> employs to compromise its victims.

INTRUSION ACTIVITY

In <TIMESTAMP>October 2014</TIMESTAMP>,<ORG>FireEye</ORG> released<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>: A Window into 
Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized 
APT28’s activity as aligning with the Russian Government’s 
strategic intelligence requirements. While tracking<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>, 
we noted the group’s interest in foreign governments and 
militaries, particularly those of European and Eastern  
European nations, as well as regional security organizations, 
such as the <ORG>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORG> (<ORG>NATO</ORG>)  
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation  
in <COUNTRY>Europe</COUNTRY> (OSCE), among others. Table 1 highlights  
some recent examples of this activity.

TABLE 2 :<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> NETWORK ACTIVITY HAS LIKELY SUPPORTED INFORMATION OPERATIONS

Since 2014,<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> network activity has likely supported 
information operations designed to influence the domestic 
politics of foreign nations. Some of these operations have 
involved the disruption and defacement of websites, false flag 
operations using false hacktivist personas, and the theft of 
data that was later leaked publicly online.  

Table 2 highlights incidents in which victims suffered 
a compromise that<ORG>FireEye</ORG> iSIGHT Intelligence, other

Investigating<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> at the World Anti-Doping Agency

As news of the <ORG>DNC</ORG> breach spread,<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> was preparing for another set 
of operations: countering the condemnation that<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY> was facing after 
doping allegations and a threatened blanket ban of the Russian team 
from the upcoming Rio Games.<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY>, like many nations, has long viewed 
success in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft 
power on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban 
from the Games further ostracized<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY>, and likely provided motivation 
to actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping 
agencies and policies. Our investigation of APT28’s compromise of 
WADA’s network, and our observations of the surrounding events reveal 
how<COUNTRY>RUSSIA</COUNTRY> sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize 
the institutions leveling criticism.

intended to advance particular<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> aims. In 
a report released on <TIMESTAMP>January 7 2017</TIMESTAMP>, the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> <ORG>Directorate of 
National Intelligence</ORG> described this activity as an “influence 
campaign.” 

This influence campaign - a combination of network 
compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely 
with the Russian military’s publicly stated intentions and 
capabilities. Influence operations, also frequently called 
“information operations,” have a long history of inclusion 
in Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally 
developed, deployed, and modernized with the advent of 
the internet. The recent activity in the <COUNTRY>U.S.</COUNTRY> is but one of 
many instances of<ORG>Russian Government</ORG> influence operations 
conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it 
will not be the last. As the 2017 elections in <COUNTRY>Europe</COUNTRY> approach 
- most notably in <COUNTRY>Germany</COUNTRY>, <COUNTRY>France</COUNTRY>, and the <COUNTRY>Netherlands</COUNTRY> - we 
are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts.

 SPECIAL REPORT /<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 9

In our 2014 report, we identified<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> as a suspected Russian 
government-sponsored espionage actor. We came to this conclusion 
in part based on forensic details left in the malware that<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> had 
employed since at least 2007. We have provided an updated version of 
those conclusions, a layout of the tactics that they generally employ, 
as well as observations of apparent tactical shifts. For full details, 
please reference our 2014 report,<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>: A Window into Russia’s Cyber 
Espionage Operations? 

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group’s 
plans for continued operations, as well as the group’s access to resources 
and skilled developers.  

Key characteristics of APT28’s toolset include:

• A flexible, modular framework that has allowed<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>  
to consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007. 

• Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop 
tools, allowing the group to create and deploy custom  
modules within its backdoors.

• Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including 
runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated 
strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused 
machine instructions to slow analysis.

• Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow 
time zone and within a Russian language build environment.

APT28’S OPERATIONAL CHANGES SINCE 2014

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> continues to evolve its toolkit and refine its tactics  
in what is almost certainly an effort to protect its operational 
effectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and 
scrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group’s 
first stage tools, we have also noted<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>:

• Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in <SOFTWARE>Adobe Flash Player</SOFTWARE>, 
<SOFTWARE>Java</SOFTWARE>, and <SOFTWARE>Windows</SOFTWARE>, including <CVE>CVE-2015-1701</CVE>, <CVE>CVE-2015-2424</CVE>, 
<CVE>CVE-2015-2590</CVE>, <CVE>CVE-2015-3043</CVE>, <CVE>CVE-2015-5119</CVE>, and <CVE>CVE-
2015-7645</CVE>. 

• Using a profiling script to deploy zero-days and other  
tools more selectively, decreasing the chance that researchers  
and others will gain access to the group’s tools.

• Increasing reliance on public code depositories, such  
as <MALWARE>Carberp</MALWARE>, <SOFTWARE>PowerShell Empire</SOFTWARE>, <SOFTWARE>P.A.S. webshell</SOFTWARE>, <SOFTWARE>Metasploit</SOFTWARE> 
modules, and others in a likely effort to accelerate their 
development cycle and provide plausible deniability.

• Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google  
App authorization and Oauth access requests that allow  
the group to bypass two-factor authentication and other 
security measures.

• Moving laterally through a network relying only  
on legitimate tools that already exist within the victims’ 
systems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the 
duration of the compromise.

These changes are not only indicative of APT28’s skills, 
resourcefulness, and desire to maintain operational 
effectiveness, but also highlight the longevity of the  
group’s mission and its intent to continue its activities  
for the foreseeable future.

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> TACTICS

We have observed<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> rely on four key tactics when attempting  
to compromise intended targets. These include sending spear-phishing 
emails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto 
a user’s systems, or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the 
recipients’ email credentials and provide access to the their accounts. 
<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites 
intending to infect site visitors, and has gained access to organizations by 
compromising their web-facing servers

.
<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> IS IN YOUR NETWORK.

Victim goes to link and  
retrieves malicious  

document or is served a 
web-based exploit that  

installs malware.

(<SOFTWARE>Flash</SOFTWARE> Vulnerability <CVE>CVE-
2016-7855</CVE> and <SOFTWARE>Windows</SOFTWARE> 

Vulnerability <CVE>CVE-2016-7255</CVE> 
were exploited as zero days to 
install malware on victims who 

visited a malicious URL).

Victim opens document, 
and malware is installed by 
exploiting a vulnerability 

(e.g., ARM-NATO_
ENGLISH_30_NOV_2016.

doc leveraged an <SOFTWARE>Adobe Flash</SOFTWARE> 
exploit, <CVE>CVE-2016-7855</CVE>,  

to install <MALWARE>GAMEFISH</MALWARE>  
targeted machine).

TACTIC

Craft exploit document  
with enticing lure content.

Send exploit document  
to victim.

Send link mirroring structure  
of legitimate organization’s 

site that is designed to 
expire once users clickit.

Register a domain spoofing 
that of a legitimate 
organization (e.g., 

theguardiannews[.]org).

INFECTION WITH MALWARE VIA SPEAR PHISH

Person is asked to authorize 
application to view mail  

and gives access.

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> leverages OAuth 
privileges given to malicious 

application to read email.

Recipient visits fake login page 
and enters credentials.

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> uses stolen  
credentials to access  

mailbox and read email. 

Register a domain spoofing a webmail service  
or an organization’s webmail portal  

(e.g., 0nedrive-0ffice365[.]com)

Send email to targets  
instructing them  

to reset their passwords.

Send email to victims  
warning of security risk  

and asking them to enable 
security service.

TACTIC

WEBMAIL ACCESS VIA SPEAR-PHISH



 SPECIAL REPORT /<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR>: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 12

<THREAT_ACTOR>APT28</THREAT_ACTOR> IS IN YOUR NETWORK.

Users of the site are redirected using malicious  
iFrame and profiled
