<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> attackers have a skeleton in
their closet?
New evidence suggests that the skeleton key malware, known as <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE>, could be linked to the
<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> malware family.

On <TIMESTAMP>January 12, 2015</TIMESTAMP>, <ORG>Dell</ORG> Secureworks blogged about a tool (<MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE>) that allows attackers to
â€œuse a password of their choosing to authenticate as any user.â€ The <MALWARE>Skelky</MALWARE> (from skeleton key)
tool is deployed when an attacker gains access to a victimâ€™s network; the attackers may also
utilize other tools and elements in their attack. 

Symantec has analyzed <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> and found that it may be linked to the <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE>
malware family. The attackers behind the <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> campaign appear to have been using the
malware in conjunction with this back door threat. Itâ€™s unclear if the malware family
<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> is used by one attack group or many groups.

During our research, we also found that <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> has been active over the past two years. Within
this timeframe, we have seen new variants and a consistent hashed password value.

Where is <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> being used?

<ORG>Symantec</ORG> telemetry identified the skeleton key malware on compromised computers in five
organizations with offices in the <COUNTRY>United States</COUNTRY> and <COUNTRY>Vietnam</COUNTRY>. The exact nature and names of the
affected organizations is unknown to <ORG>Symantec</ORG>. The first activity was seen in <TIMESTAMP>January 2013</TIMESTAMP> and <TIMESTAMP>until November 2013</TIMESTAMP>, there was no further activity involving the skeleton key malware.
<TIMESTAMP>In November 2013</TIMESTAMP>, the attackers increased their usage of the tool and have been active ever since. Four more
variants of <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> were discovered as well as additional file names used by the attackers. The
complete set of observed file names and hashes are listed as follows

<IOC>msuta64.dll</IOC>: <IOC>66da7ed621149975f6e643b4f9886cfd</IOC>

The link between <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE>
From the first observed use of the tool in <TIMESTAMP>January 2013</TIMESTAMP> to the present, the attackers have consistently
used the same password. This is the case with three different variants of the tool. The regular use of
the same password across multiple variants means itâ€™s likely that only one group of attackers has
been using the tool <TIMESTAMP>until at least January 2015</TIMESTAMP>. 

By identifying any other malware active on compromised computers at the same time as
<MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE>, it is possible to learn more about the attackers. There were almost no signs of other
malware active at the same time as <MALWARE>Skelky</MALWARE> in most of the organizations investigated. However, two
compromised computers had other malware present, active, and in the same directory, at the same
time as <MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE>. 

Two files were discovered on one of the victimâ€™s computers. One file is a variant of
<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> (<IOC>jqs.exe</IOC>) and the other is a dropper for <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> (tmp8296.tmp), which is
responsible for creating the <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> sample. Details on the file names and hashes are as
follows:

<IOC>jqs.exe</IOC> (<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> dropper): <IOC>600b604784594e3339776c6563aa45a1</IOC>
<IOC>tmp8296.tmp</IOC> (<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> variant): <IOC>48377c1c4cfedebe35733e9c3675f9be</IOC>

<MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> has been used in the past in a number of different campaigns, most notably against
Asian games companies. Given the disparate nature of some victims, itâ€™s unclear if the malware
is used by one set of attackers, or many. <ORG>Symantec</ORG> is continuing its investigation into this malware
family <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> and the specific actors behind the combined use of <MALWARE>Backdoor.Winnti</MALWARE> and
<MALWARE>Trojan.Skelky</MALWARE>.
