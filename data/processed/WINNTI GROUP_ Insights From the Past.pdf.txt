<THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> GROUP: Insights From the Past
quointelligence.eu/2020/04/WINNTI-group-insights-from-the-past

Newly uncovered DNS tunnelling technique, and new
campaign against South Korean gaming company

Executive Summary
In <TIMESTAMP>January 2020</TIMESTAMP>, <ORG>QuoIntelligence</ORG> (<ORG>QuoINT</ORG>) detected a new <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample uploaded to a
public virus scanner from a German location. Following our preliminary analysis, we
assessed with high confidence that the sample was used to target
a previously unreported German chemical company. As part of our responsible disclosure,
we alerted the affected entity, the local Law Enforcements, and our clients.
In the following weeks after our internal reporting, the German news media source
<ORG>Tagesschau</ORG> reported our initial detection and analysis of the sample, and confirmed the
chemical company’s awareness of the attack in <TIMESTAMP>the second half of 2019</TIMESTAMP>.
The <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample we analysed was highly likely developed in 2015, and likely used
around this year for the first time, it is unclear how long the compromise existed in the
compromised environment.
Although the malware was likely used years ago, further analysis revealed a previously
unreported C2 technique never attributed to any <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group’s toolkits.
The technique relies on a DNS Tunneling communication channel through a custom
implementation of the iodine source code, an open-source software that enables the
tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server.
Additionally, we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certificate being used to
digitally sign <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR>-related attack components, and the targeting of a previously-unreported
South Korean video game company.
The sophistication of the techniques we uncovered confirms that the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group is a
highly sophisticated, and highly committed Advanced Persistent Group  targeting a plethora
of different industry sectors in <COUNTRY>Europe</COUNTRY> and <COUNTRY>South Asia</COUNTRY>.

Introduction
The <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group (also known as <THREAT_ACTOR>APT41</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR>, and <THREAT_ACTOR>Blackfly</THREAT_ACTOR>) is an alleged Chinese state-
sponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared
goals and attack resources. The suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government pinpoints
that it likely has an incentive to continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s
highlighted as priority for China’s economic development.

On <TIMESTAMP>Friday, 13 January<TIMESTAMP>, <ORG>QuoIntelligence</ORG> (<ORG>QuoINT</ORG>) detected a new <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample uploaded to a
public virus scanner from a German location. Following our preliminary analysis, we assessed

chemical company. Additionally, during our analysis we uncovered a previously unknown stolen
digital certificate being used to digitally sign <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> related drivers, and a potential campaign
against an already known South Korean video game company. 

In the last year, researchers and journalists have publicly disclosed that the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> group targeted
and eventually compromised <ORG>Henkel</ORG> (2014), <ORG>BASF</ORG> (2015), <ORG>Bayer</ORG> (2018) and <ORG>Roche</ORG> (2019). This
most recent previously unreported German chemical company is yet another German chemical
company targeted by <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> since 2015. Prior to our analysis this attack activity was not publicly
reported.

Figure 1: Timeline of attacks located in Germany and attributed to <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR>

In <TIMESTAMP>December 2019</TIMESTAMP>, <ORG>Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution</ORG> (BfV) released
a report related to the alleged Chinese state sponsored umbrella organization known as the
<THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group. Through our internal malware analysis, we are confident that the sample we
discovered is highly similar to the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample described in the BfV report. The sample also
matches known characteristics of <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR>’s arsenal shared through intelligence reports produced
by <ORG>ESET</ORG>.

Further, we have informed the affected company, law enforcement agencies, and sent a Warning
to our customers upon detection.

The <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group
The <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group (also known as <THREAT_ACTOR>APT41</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR>, and <THREAT_ACTOR>Blackfly</THREAT_ACTOR>) is an alleged Chinese state-
sponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared
goals and attack resources. Notably, various operations attributed to other China-linked threat
actor groups, such as <THREAT_ACTOR>APT17</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Ke3chang</THREAT_ACTOR>, have also leveraged its backdoor malware. Active
since at least 2010, initial attacks attributed to the group heavily targeted the gaming industry.
However, as researchers have continued to follow and dissect the group and its activity, the
group’s target focus has expanded to other industries, including <INDUSTRY>chemical</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>pharmaceutical</INDUSTRY>,
<INDUSTRY>technology</INDUSTRY>, and <INDUSTRY>software</INDUSTRY>. Further, the group’s evolution involves the <INDUSTRY>enhancement</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>development</INDUSTRY>,
and inclusion of new tools and tactics.

The suspected state-sponsor link to <ORG>China’s government</ORG>, pinpoints that it likely has an incentive
to continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s
economic development. In the latest <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group public report, <ORG>FireEye</ORG> researchers reported of

a new widespread campaign attributed to <THREAT_ACTOR>APT41</THREAT_ACTOR> which involves exploitation attempts of recently
disclosed and patched vulnerabilities for products of <ORG>Cisco</ORG>, <ORG>Citrix</ORG>, and <ORG>Zoho</ORG>. The campaign
waves apparently take a more targeted approach to selecting potential victims across various
sectors including <INDUSTRY>financials</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>government</INDUSTRY>, and <INDUSTRY>information technology</INDUSTRY>. According to the
researchers, identified victim systems demonstrated the threat actor leveraged commercially
available post exploitation tools such as <MALWARE>Cobalt Strike</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Meterpreter</MALWARE>, which are essentially full
featured backdoors.

Technical Analysis

Sample Targeting German Chemical Company
The main artifact uploaded to VirusTotal is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file, with a compilation
timestamp suggesting the sample was built in <TIMESTAMP>>August 2015</TIMESTAMP>. Although the compilation time might
be legitimate, it is not possible to determine when and how long the attackers used this malware.

Analysis of <IOC>dsefix.exe</IOC>

This is essentially Windows x64 Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider (DSEFix), used   to
temporarily disable the driver signature enforcement on Windows systems by using an included
old, legit VirtualBox driver, both signed and exploitable. By running dsefix.exe, the malware can

bypass driver verification and install its own drivers. We identified the following two drivers which
were embedded in the earlier described main artifact. To note that this technique does not work
on moden Windows (e.g. <SOFTWARE>Windows 10</SOFTWARE>) – yet another piece of evidence that this malware was
designed and used multiple years ago.

Analysis of vboxdriver

This is the vulnerable, correctly signed with a digital certificate, <SOFTWARE>VirtualBox</SOFTWARE> driver that is used for
exploitation. It is used regularly by various threat actors, and by the previously highlighted
dsefix.exe. The driver can also be used to perform the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) exploitation
technique, a similar technique as DSEFix.

Analysis of driver1.sys

In late 2019, <ORG>ExaTrack</ORG> released their analysis of a signed <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> rootkit previously observed in
the wild, which we confirm is essentially the same rootkit driver.  The sample is capable of
injecting raw packets into the network and receiving special formatted packets. In comparison,
our variant has the same exact number of bytes, and there are large parts exactly matching.

Analysis of driver2.sys

This rootkit driver seems to be largely the same as driver1.sys with the same characteristics
including structure, I/O control, and device strings. However, this driver supports different versions
of Windows. It checks for ranges of Windows New Technology (NT) build numbers and returns
early.

C2 DNS Tunneling

By analyzing the malware, it is possible to find two network indicators within its code:

Figure 3 – observed network IoCs in <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample

The hardcoded 208.67.222.222 is a legitimate OpenDNS DNS server (resolver1.opendns.com).
This IP is pushed into a list that is generated by the malware at runtime. Likely, the initiation
routine also populates the list with the system’s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as
fallback case to ensure the C2 domain gets resolved.

The dick[.]mooo[.]com FQDN name is offered by FreeDNS, which is a free dynamic DNS service.
Notably, in the last years, multiple researchers have reported <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR>/PlugX C2 hostnames hosted
in the mooo[.]com zone. In the code we observed that a dot (.) is enforced before the FQDN.
Additional analysis revealed that the malware generates subdomains with base128 encoding, and
append them to FQDN.

Code 1 – Hostname length restriction

Further, dots are added into it every 57 characters potentially as a hostname length restriction,
suggesting the expectation of long hostnames. We confirm the buffer can support FQDN’s up to
2000 characters.

Upon further investigation we found out that the malware includes the open source iodine source
code – software that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server. Interestingly, we
are not aware of any earlier documentation highlighting <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> specifically leveraging iodine for
DNS tunneling. However, researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum, while hunting for DNS
tunnels, observed <THREAT_ACTOR>APT32</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Wekby</THREAT_ACTOR> APT groups using NULL and TXT records as a C2
communication channel, as well as mentioning the mooo[.]com top level domain in their findings.

The implementation of iodine used in the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample is integrated and uses some custom
wrapper, as evidence by the matching functions we discuss in further detail in the following
section.

Use of Iodine for C2 DNS Tunneling

The iodine DNS tunneling solution is embedded in the DLL that is initially loaded and executed in
memory, and includes at least the following 15 matching functions:

Table 3 – Malware DLL Functions

For instance, the 64bit executable contains the build_hostname function (Code 2), which
corresponds with the older 32bit version (compiled with debug symbols) of iodine 0.6.0 (Code 3):

Code 2- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname

Code 3- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname

Based on the presence of the functions base128_blksize_enc and base128_blksize_raw, we
determined the version used, while not exactly known, is from before May 2017 when a patch
removed those functions. Further, comparative analysis indicates that for the implementation of
iodine in this <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> attack operation, there is no perfect match for the two versions having 64bit
pre-compiled binaries. This indicates iodine was compiled from source, and it is reasonable it is
being used as a library, and not in its normal distribution format of a standalone executable.

https://quointelligence.eu/2020/04/WINNTI-group-insights-from-the-past/ 8/13

The DNS Tunneling technique adopted by the malware through the use of iodine is detailed in the
figure below.

Figure 4 – C2 channel over DNS

1. The malware generates a hostname and appends it to the embedded C2
<IOC>dick[.]mooo[.]com</IOC>, and makes a NULL query to the resulted FQDN (e.g. abcde is appended
to <IOC>dick[.]mooo[.]com)</IOC>. Notably, NULL and TXT DNS request types are iodine’s preferred
channels since they are “expected to provide the largest downstream bandwidth”. It is
hence not a coincidence that researchers at Ruhr University Bochum also observed an
extensive use of NULL request types for DNS Tunneling purposes in their research.

2. The infected host sends the DNS query to one of the DNS servers included in the list
populated at runtime, eventually to the OpenDNS fallback server. At this point the DNS
server executes a recursive DNS query by contacting the Name Servers (NS) of each zone,
until the Authoritative NS of <IOC>dick[.]mooo[.]com</IOC> is obtained. To note, FreeDNS does provide
users the capability to delegate the authority of their subdomains to external NS. In the
described scenario, attackers delegated the NS of their subdomain to use their NS as a de-
facto C2 server.

3. The DNS server returns the authoritative answer by forwarding the content of the NULL
record type to the infected host. Notably, the legit DNS server acts as a proxy between the
infected host and the malicious server, by making impossible for defenders the application
of any filtering at the Network (L3) level.

The NULL DNS record type

The implementation of NULL type tunneling can be observed in the following excerpt taken while
reversing the malware:

https://github.com/yarrick/iodine

https://quointelligence.eu/2020/04/WINNTI-group-insights-from-the-past/ 9/13

The third argument when calling dns_encode shall be of the type “struct query”
from Iodine’s dns.c

According to common.h, “struct query” is defined as:

Since QUERY_NAME_SIZE equals to 512  (4
*128 – integers are 4 bytes) the query[128] call
obtained from the reversing activity is indeed
the DNS query type.

As noted, reversing activity detailed the
query[128] value to be 0xa. From
Iodine’s windows.h T_NULL is
DNS_TYPE_NULL

Finally, from Windows’s
documentation, DNS_TYPE_NULL is actually a
Windows constant equal to 0xa

<THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Signed Code With Digital Certificate from IQ Technology

During our analysis of the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample configured to target the German chemical company, our
comparative analysis of other <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> related drivers revealed a digital certificate issued to IQ
Technology, a Taiwanese company producing Natural language processing (NLP) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) software. The rootkit driver aligns with the already known driver1.sys. While it is a
known TTP that <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> attributed attacks have involved stolen digital certificates for code signing
its malware components, the use of this certificate is not publicly discussed, except for a brief
report from a security researcher apparently associated with a Vietnamese security company.
Although the report is no longer online,  the discussed sample contains a compilation timestamp
of August 2015, which is the earliest one observed in the wild that we identified using this digital
certificate. At the time of analysis, the digital certificate was already revoked.

The sample’s structure, debug symbols, and explanatory debug messages included within
suggests it is highly likely be a development version. Additionally, the compilation timestamp
indicates the sample was created 20 minutes prior to the driver1.sys.  Both samples are highly
related, and its contents combined with the date of  analysis and reporting essentially solidify that
it existed in 2015; however, this does not necessarily corroborate to an attack timeframe.

Table 3 – observed network IoCs in <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> sample

On 21 February, we detected the new submission of a 64-bit <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> executable to a public online
malware scanning service. As multiple researchers have reported, <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> operators embed the
name of their target directly into the malware, but in an obfuscated manner.

Binary Analysis

The sample resembles the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Dropper Install.exe described by ESET, since it is a command
line executable used to drop and load additional encrypted payload:

Unfortunately we were not able to find the payload meant to be decrypted by this dropper.

However, we were able to extract the malware’s configuration file and identify the intended target.
In this case, the following string was included within the extracted configuration:

Based on previous knowledge and targeting of the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group, we assess that this sample was
likely used to target <ORG>Gravity Co., Ltd.</ORG>, a South Korean video game company. The company is
known for its Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Ragnarok Online, which
is also offered as a mobile application. As we have also reported in the past, the video game
industry is one of the preferred targets of the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group, especially for those companies
operating in <COUNTRY>South Korea</COUNTRY> and <COUNTRY>Taiwan</COUNTRY>. Interestingly, <ORG>ESET</ORG> researchers, while reporting on multiple
<THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group campaigns targeting the video game industry, listed in their report a C2 server
having a Campaign ID GRA KR 0629.

Excerpt from ESET Research White paper “CONNECTING THE DOTS Exposing the arsenal and
methods of the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group”

At this time, we do not have any further evidence supporting a potential link between the sample
we analysed and the C2 detailed by <ORG>ESET</ORG>, but the coincidence between the C2 Campaign
ID/Location with the Campaign ID we extracted from the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> dropper is worth noting.

https://quointelligence.eu/2020/04/WINNTI-group-insights-from-the-past/ 12/13

The <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group has exhibited their ability to breach different organizations and conduct
sophisticated attack operations, typically motivated by espionage and financial gain, with various
TTPs and malware toolkits. While attribution is not concrete due to the complexity of the group,
there are links that can be drawn between operations which suggest the threat actors purporting
the attacks are likely operating within the <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group, or at least sharing resources.  

The detection of this unreported <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> variant uploaded to VirusTotal and targeting a German
chemical company aligns with our prior observations and research from previous intelligence
reporting highlighting <THREAT_ACTOR>WINNTI</THREAT_ACTOR> Group’s interest in German DAX companies. As a result,
organizations of all sizes, but especially small to medium sized companies, including Germany’s
hidden champions, should prepare against such threats as they are vital to the economic
ecosystem and continuous development of niche markets. Government oversight (local, regional,
and across the EU) should ensure susceptible organizations such as these are following
regulation and implementing security best practices to protect against future attacks.

– For DNS Tunnel, ensure that DNS logs are collected
and reviewed.

– DNS telemetic data should be also collected in order to
spot frequent and  heavy loaded DNS communication that
are definitely not related to an usual DNS query.

– FreeDNS and DynDNS servers should be
blacklisted/synkholed if not strictly required

– DNS NULL type queries should not be avoided. Only
the required record types should be allowed.
