Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti: attacks on servers - Securelist


Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is a widely known APT group active since at least 2010. The group tends

to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies

attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious

concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey

increased significantly.

The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting

various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and

logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main

targets.

Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked

the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.

This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected

and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers

compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017.

The link is used to initiate a request for an image, as a result of which the user connects to the

remote server over the SMB protocol. In this attack type, the attackers’ goal is to extract the

following data from the session:

user IP,

user name,

domain name,

NTLM hash of the user’s password.

It should be noted that the image requested using the link is not physically located on the remote

server.

Scanned resourcesScanned resources
Compromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the process

of analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identif ied that the attackers had

scanned with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided

below).

The sites and servers on this list do not seem to have anything in common. Even though the scanned

servers do not necessarily look like potential f inal victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned

different resources to f ind a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the

attackers’ tools and, subsequently, to develop the attack.

Part of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting

waterhole resources.

In some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went

through the list of possible domains matching a given IP.

In most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specif ic target were not identif ied – with the

possible exception of sites on the Bump platform, f light tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel

chain.

Curiously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to

which were found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner:

www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru

Toolset usedToolset used

UtilitiesUtilities

Utilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:

Nmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security.

Dirsearch — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive searches of)

directories and f iles on websites.

Sqlmap — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of identifying

and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database servers.

Sublist3r — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. The tool uses

open-source intelligence (OSINT). Sublist3r supports many different search engines, such as

Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd,

DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. The tool helps penetration testers to collect information on the

subdomains of the domain they are researching.

Wpscan — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e., works without

access to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress sites in search of security

issues.

Impacket — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by SMBTrap.

SMBTrap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address, user name,

domain name, password NTLM hash).

Commix — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in Python.

Subbrute – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses an open

name resolver as a proxy and does not send traff ic to the target DNS server.

PHPMailer – a mail sending tool.

In addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers. The script

was designed to check FTP hosts from an incoming list.

Malicious php filesMalicious php files

The following malicious php f iles were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in a

working directory created by the attackers on an infected web servers:

Web shell is a script that allows remote administration of the machine.

WSO is a popular web shell and f ile manager (it stands for “Web Shell by Orb”) that has the ability

to masquerade as an error page containing a hidden login form. It is available on GitHub:

https://github.com/wso-shell/WSO

Two of the PHP scripts found, ini.php and mysql.php, contained a WSO shell concatenated with the

following email spamming script:

Modified sshdModified sshd

A modif ied sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the server.

Patches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are

available on GitHub, for example:

https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit

Compilation is possible on any OS with binary compatibility.

As a result of replacing the original sshd f ile with a modif ied one on the infected server, an attacker

can use a ‘master password’ to get authorized on the remote server, while leaving minimal traces

(compared to an ordinary user connecting via ssh).

In addition, the modif ied sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections (this does not apply to the

connection that uses the ‘master password’), including connection times, account names and

passwords. The log is encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock.

Activity of the attackers onActivity of the attackers on
compromised serverscompromised servers
In addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity was

also identif ied.

After gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times.

Specif ically, the following commands for third-party installations were identif ied on one of the

servers:

apt install traceroute

apt-get install nmap

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


apt-get install screen

git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git

Additionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.

The diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one

month. The attackers checked the smbtrap log f ile on working days. In most cases, they logged on to

the server at roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:

Times of il legitimate connections with the server (GMT+3)Times of il legitimate connections with the server (GMT+3)

In addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identif ied that exploited

SQL injection and collected data from a database of one of the victims.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


ConclusionConclusion
The f indings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are

as follows:

1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. The use of publicly

available utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution

without any additional group ‘markers’ very diff icult.

2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want to

establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities.

3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching for

vulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication data.

4. The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests.

5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or

takes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data collection, the theft of

authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack’s further

development.
