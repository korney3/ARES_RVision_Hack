RoyalCli and RoyalDNS
In May 2017, NCC Group's Incident Response team reacted to an ongoing incident where our
client, which provides a range of services to UK Government, suffered a network compromise
involving the advanced persistent threat group APT15.

APT15 is also known as, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda GREF
and Playful Dragon.

A number of sensitive documents were stolen by the attackers during the incident and we
believe APT15 was targeting information related to UK government departments and military
technology.

APT15 expands its arsenal
During our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be
part of APT15's toolset. The backdoor BS2005 - which has traditionally been used by the
group - now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS.

The RoyalCli backdoor appears to be an evolution of BS2005 and uses familiar encryption and
encoding routines. The name RoyalCli was chosen by us due to a debugging path left in the
binary:

c:\users\wizard\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\RoyalCli\Release\RoyalCli.pdb

RoyalCli and BS2005 both communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2)
through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2. Due to the nature of
the technique, this results in C2 data being cached to disk by the IE process; we'll get to this
later.

Analysis of the domains and IP address infrastructure used by APT15 identified a number of
similar possible domains, shown at the bottom of the post. These appeared to be hosted on
either Linode or Google Cloud, with a preference for using the ASN AS63949.

All of the backdoors identified - excluding RoyalDNS - required APT15 to create batch scripts
in order to install its persistence mechanism. This was achieved through the use of a simple
Windows run key. We believe that APT15 could have employed this technique in order to

evade behavioural detection, rather than due to a lack of sophistication or development
capability.

Additional tools were recovered during the incident, including a network scanning/enumeration
tool, the archiving tool WinRAR and a bespoke Microsoft SharePoint enumeration and data
dumping tool, known as 'spwebmember'.

spwebmember was written in Microsoft .NET and includes hardcoded values for client project
names for data extraction. The tool would connect to the SQL SharePoint database and issue
a query to dump all data from the database to a temporary file affixed with 'spdata'. The group
also used keyloggers and their own .NET tool to enumerate folders and dump data from
Microsoft Exchange mailboxes.

APT15 was also observed using Mimikatz to dump credentials and generate Kerberos golden
tickets. This allowed the group to persist in the victim's network in the event of remediation
actions being undertaken, such as a password reset.

APT15 lives off the land
Upon ejection from the network, APT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via
the corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a
compromised host.

This time, APT15 opted for a DNS based backdoor: RoyalDNS. The persistence mechanism
used by RoyalDNS was achieved through a service called 'Nwsapagent'.

C2 of this backdoor was performed using the TXT record of the DNS protocol. C2 was
communicating with the domain 'andspurs[.]com'.

We mentioned earlier that due to the nature of the IE injection technique used by the HTTP-
based backdoors, a number of C2 commands were cached to disk. We were able to recover
these files and reverse engineer the encoding routine used by the backdoors in order to
uncover the exact commands executed by the attacker.

In total, we were able to recover more than 200 commands executed by the attacker against
the compromised hosts and were able to gain a clear insight into the attacker's TTPs. Our
decode scripts can be found on our Github page: https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT
(https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT)

Analysis of the commands executed by APT15 reaffirmed the group's preference to 'live off the
land'. They utilised Windows commands in order to enumerate and conduct reconnaissance
activities such as tasklist.exe, ping.exe, netstat.exe, net.exe, systeminfo.exe, ipconfig.exe and
bcp.exe.

Lateral movement was conducted through by a combination of net command, mounting the
C$ share of hosts and manually copying files to or from compromised hosts. APT15 then used
a tool known as RemoteExec (similar to Microsoft's Psexec) in order to remotely execute batch
scripts and binaries.

During our analysis of the decoded attacker commands we noticed a typographical mistake,
shown below in the folder name 'systme'. This indicates that a human operative was executing
commands on a command line style interface, rather than an automated or GUI process.

NCC Group & Fox-IT have created a number of Suricata IDS rules to detect APT15 activity
through the use of these backdoors. These, along with YARA signatures for the backdoors
identified, can be found in the Github repository linked above.

Domains
The RoyalCli backdoor was attempting to communicate to the following domains:

News.memozilla[.]org
video.memozilla[.]org

The BS2005 backdoor utilised the following domains for C2:

Run.linodepower[.]com
Singa.linodepower[.]com
log.autocount[.]org

RoyalDNS backdoor was seen communicating to the domain:

andspurs[.]com

Possible linked APT15 domains include:

Micakiz.wikaba[.]org
cavanic9[.]net
ridingduck[.]com
zipcodeterm[.]com
dnsapp[.]info
