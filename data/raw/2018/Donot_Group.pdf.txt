Background
Recently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center is investigating one email phishing attack which is targeting one
Pakistani businessman who is working in China. First attack of this campaign took place in May 2018.
Attackers have taken over of target machines over months. TTP of this targeting attack will be introduced,
as well as remediation advice.

We identified this APT group coded as ‘APT-C-35’ in 2017, who is mainly targeting Pakistan and other
South Asian countries for cyber espionage[1]. Arbor also published APT research on this group, and
named it ‘Donot’[2]. The group attacked government agencies, aiming for classified intelligence. At least 4
attack campaigns against Pakistan have been observed by us since 2017. Spear phishing emails with
vulnerable Office documents or malicious macros are sent to victims. Two unique malware frameworks,
EHDevel and yty, are developed by attackers. In the latest attack, Donot group is targeting Pakistani
businessman working in China.

Fishing Attack
The process of attacking target is as following:

Dropper - Excel Macros

Attackers lure victim to open decoy Excel file with malicious macro which is sent as attachment in a
phishing email. While macro code is running, office_update.exe is dropped at C:\micro and run. The decoy
Excel document pretends to be pricing list of one BMW car, which is easy to have trust of the victim:

Downloader - office_update. exe

filename office_update.exe

MD5 2320ca79f627232979314c974e602d3a

Office_updata.exe is a downloader, which is able to download a BAT file by
http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushBatch:

The BAT file is mainly to modify registry for persistence, and create a directory with hidden property, etc. It
can also download wlidsvcc.exe from http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushAgent, then save it in
%USERPROFILE%\BackConfig\BackUp directory:

After that, Office_updata.exe will remove itself from system.

Plugin - Downloader - wlidsvcc.exe

Filename wlidsvcc.exe

Wlidsvcc.exe is also a downloader. It downloads 3 plugins from C2 server, naming wuaupdt.exe, kylgr.exe,
and svchots.exe. Mutex "wlidsvcc" is created to ensure that only one instance runs in system:

Then, it determines if the current process path is %USERPROFILE%BackConfig\BackUp\wlidsvcc.exe:

If the path meets condition, wlidsvcc.exe communicates with C2 (bigdata.akamaihub.stream) by POST,
which is to retrieve remote commands

If C2 sends ‘no’ command, wlidsvcc.exe will retry to contact C2 after sleeping for 90 seconds:

If ‘cmdline’ command is received, wlidsvcc.exe runs plug-in
%USERPROFILE%\BackConfig\BackUp\wuaupdt.exe, and then listens for follow-up commands:

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 4/20

If commands are neither ‘no’ nor ‘cmdline’, wlidsvcc.exe downloads
http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/orderMe to C:\Users\%s\BackConfig\BigData, then puts itself into waiting
mode:

Plugin executor - wuaupdt.exe

Filename Wuaupdt.exe

MD5 35ec92dbd07f1ca38ec2ed4c4893f7ed

wuaupdt.exe is a CMD backdoor, which can receive and execute CMD commands sent from C2. It can also
execute other plugins if commands are issued by attackers. The analysis of all backdoor plugins is shown
in the following section.

Execute C2 commands:

Backdoor - Plugins

wuaupdt.exe will execute corresponding plug-ins according to the commands issued by attackers. All
plugins’ details are as following.

Keylogger - Kylgr.exe

This plugin is a keylogger. It firstly creates a file inc3++.txt in current directory and check whether a
keylogging file exists in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood directory. If yes, it saves log file name
and its last modification time to inc3++.txt:

If keylogging file is found in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, the log file is moved to directory
%USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood\Spools:

A new keylogging file is created in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, with filename
‘username_year_month_day(hour_minute_second)’. Then, it monitors activities of mouse and keyboard
constantly.

Pivoting
Some other decoy documents and plugins are found to have connections with the files in this attack.

CSD_Promotion_Scheme_2018. XLS

Filename CSD_Promotion_Scheme_2018. XLS

MD5 82a5b24fddc40006396f5e1e453dc256

The decoy document is an Excel file with malicious macros. When it is opened, a window of Excel security
disclamation pop up, warning user that this file has risky macros:

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 14/20

The main function of malicious macro code is to drop skypet.exe in the directory %APPDATA%, and to drop
skype.bat in the directory C:\Skype. skypet.bat is executed after that:

Same pricing list of a BMW car is content of the Excel file:

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 15/20

Skyep.bat

Skyep.bat creates 3 directories %USERPROFILE%Printers\Spools,
%USERPROFILE%BackConfig\BackUp and %USERPROFILE%BackConfig\BigData , and then sets these
folder properties to hidden:

The BAT file also gets the computer name, and save it into
%USERPROFILE%\BackConfig\Backup\pcap.txt:

And it creates multiple registry entries for persistence. Then, it starts skyep.exe and deletes itself:

Skyep.exe, disguising as a voice software Skype, downloads csrsses.exe from
http://databig.akamaihub.stream/pushBatch (it is still alive) to the \BackConfig\BackUp\ for running:

Csrsses.exe

The file name Csrsses.exe.

MD5 e0c0148ca11f988f292f527733e54fca

This file, similar to wlidsvcc.exe, is to execute commands from C2 server. Firstly, it reads computer name
from \\BackConfig\\BackUp\\pcap.txt

The computer name is then processed to a string: "orderme/computer name - random number". It contacts
C2 databig.akamaihub.stream for commands:

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 17/20

It check value of Content-Type to determine next operation. If the value is "application", it downloads file
from C2 to \\BackConfig\\BigData\\ directory:

If the value is "cmdline", \\BackConfig\\BigData\\wuaupdt.exe is executed:

If command is"batcmd", \\BackConfig\\BigData\\test.bat is started:

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 18/20

By analyzing the macro code, plugins, domain name /IP correlation in the attack, we confirm that Donot
APT Group (APT-C-35) is behind the attack.

Similarity of Macro Code
ASERT disclosed one macro sample linking to DONOT APT Group in March 2018[2]. That macro sample is
very similar to the sample in this attack: a decoy picture is pop up after macro runs.

Similarity of Plug-ins

Similar to previous Donot samples, new sample downloads plugins from C2. It is also packed by UPX and
is written in Go language. Furthermore, it has similar code logic as previous ones

wuaupdt.exe in this attack appears in previous Donot attack[1], and C2 addresses are same to previous
ones.

Conclusion

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 19/20

From the attack activity captured this time, it is obvious that Donot APT group is still keen on Pakistan as
primary target of attack, and even expands scope of attack to include Pakistani staffs and institutions in
China. There is a sign that the Donot group has never stopped its attacks and another cyber espionage
attack could be launched soon.

360 Threat Intelligence Center suggests enterprises to improve employees' security awareness by provide
them sufficient security training, especially anti-phishing training. Situational awareness, asset
management, and threat intelligence can prevent such attacks significantly.

For 360 ESG customers, detection to Donot group and related IOCs are supported by products integrated
with threat intelligence, including 360 Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye Advance Threat Detection
System, 360 NGSOC.
