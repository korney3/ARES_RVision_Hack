Harm” Principle

At last year’s Security Analyst Summit 2017 we predicted that medical

networks would be a titbit for cybercriminals. Unfortunately, we were

right. The numbers of medical data breaches and leaks are increasing.

According to public data, this year is no exception.

For a year we have been observing how cybercriminals encrypt medical

data and demand a ransom for it. How they penetrate medical networks

and exfiltrate medical information, and how they find medical data on

publicly available medical resources.

Opened doors in medical
networks
To find a potential entry point into medical infrastructure, we extract the

IP ranges of all organizations that have the keywords “medic”, “clinic”,

“hospit”, “surgery” and “healthcare” in the organization’s name, then we

start the masscan (port scanner) and parse the specialized search engines

(like Shodan and Censys) for publicly available resources of these

organizations.

Of course, medical perimeters contain a lot of trivial opened ports and

services: like web-server, DNS-server, mail-server etc. And you know

that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The most interesting part is the non-

trivial ports. We left out trivial services, because as we mentioned in our

previous article those services are out of date and need to be patched. For

example, the web applications of electronic medical records that we

found on the perimeters in most cases were out of date.

The most popular ports are the tip of the iceberg. The most interesting

part is the non-trivial ports.

The most popular opened ports on medical perimeters (18,723 live hosts;

27,716 opened ports)

Using ZTag tool and Censys, we identify what kinds of services are hidden

behind these ports. If you try to look deeper in the embedded tag you will

see different stuff: for example printers, SCADA-type systems, NAS etc.

Top services on medical network perimeters

Excluding these trivial things, we found Building Management systems

that out of date. Devices using the Niagara Fox protocol usually operate

on TCP ports 1911 and 4911. They allow us to gather information remotely

from them, such as application name, Java version, host OS, time zone,

local IP address, and software versions involved in the stack.

Or printers that have a web interface without an authentication request.

The dashboard available online and allows you to get information about

internal Wi-Fi networks or, probably, it allows you to get info about

documents that appeared in “Job Storage” logs.

Shodan told us that some medical organizations have an opened port

2000. It’s a smart kettle. We don’t know why, but this model of kettle is

very popular in medical organizations. And they have publicly available

information about a vulnerability that allows a connection to the kettle to

be established using a simple pass and to extract info about the current

Wi-Fi connection.

Medical infrastructure has a lot of medical devices, some of them

portable. And devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors

support the MQTT protocol to communicate with other devices directly.

One of the main components of the MQTT communication – brokers (see

here for detailed information about components) are available through

the Internet and, as a result, we can find some medical devices online.

Not only Smart Home components, but also medical devices are available

via MQTT Spirometer

Threats that affect medical
networks
OK, now we know how they get in. But what’s next? Do they search for

personal data, or want to get some money with a ransom or maybe

something else? Money? It’s possible… anything is possible. Let’s take a

look at some numbers that we collected during 2017.

The statistics are a bit worrying. More than 60% of medical organizations

had some kind of malware on their servers or computers. The good news

is that if we count something here, it means we’ve deleted malware in the

system.

Attacks detected in medical organizations, 2017

And there’s something even more interesting – organizations closely

connected to hospitals, clinics and doctors, i.e. the pharmaceutical

industry. Here we see even more attacks. The pharmaceutical industry

means “money”, so it’s another titbit for attackers.

Attacks detected in pharmaceutical organizations, 2017

Let’s return to our patients. Where are all these attacked hospitals and

clinics? Ok, here we the numbers are relative: we divided the number of

devices in medical organizations in the country with our AV by the

number of devices where we detected malicious code. The TOP 3 were

the Philippines, Venezuela and Thailand. Japan, Saudi Arabia and Mexico

took the last three spots in the TOP 15.

So the chances of being attacked really depend on how much money the

government spends on cybersecurity in the public sector and the level of

cybersecurity awareness.

Attacked devices in medical organizations, TOP 15 countries

In the pharmaceutical industry we have a completely different picture.

First place belongs to Bangladesh. I googled this topic and now the stats

look absolutely ok to me. Bangladesh exports meds to Europe. In

Morocco big pharma accounts for 14% of GDP. India, too, is in the list, and

even some European countries are featured.

Attacked devices in pharmaceutical organizations, TOP 15 countries

On one in ten devices and in more than 25% of medical and 10% of

pharmaceutical companies we detected hacktools: pentesting tools like

Mimikatz, Meterpreter, tweaked remote administration kits, and so on.

Which means that either medical organizations are very mature in terms

of cybersecurity and perform constant audits of their own infrastructure

using red teams and professional pentesters, or, more likely, their

networks are infested with hackers.

Hacktools: Powerpreter, Meterpreter, Remote admin, etc.

APT

Our research showed that APT actors are interested in information from

pharmaceutical organizations. We were able to identify victims in South

East Asia, or more precisely, in Vietnam and Bangladesh. The criminals

had targeted servers and used the infamous PlugX malware or Cobalt

Strike to exfiltrate data.

PlugX RAT, used by Chinese-speaking APT actors, allows criminals to

perform various malicious operations on a system without the user’s

knowledge or authorization, including but not limited to copying and

modifying files, logging keystrokes, stealing passwords and capturing

screenshots of user activity. PlugX, as well as Cobalt Strike, is used by

cybercriminals to discreetly steal and collect sensitive or profitable

information. During our research we were unable to track the initial attack

vectors, but there are signs that they could be attacks exploiting

vulnerable software on servers.

Taking into account the fact that hackers placed their implants on the

servers of pharmaceutical companies, we can assume they are after

intellectual property or business plans.

How to live with it
Remove all nodes that process medical data from public

Periodically update your installed software and remove unwanted

applications

Refrain from connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN of

your organization
