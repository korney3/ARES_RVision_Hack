During the last weeks of January (2018), nation state actors from APT32 (Lotus Blossom)  conducted  a

targeted malspam campaign against the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.   This

isn't terribly surprising considering the group's watering hole activity against ASEAN websites   as

observed in the Fall of 2017.   In another apparent prong of attack, the new campaign delivers a malicious

RTF document   posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also

carries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise backdoor.

The Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed  in the past by Industry

researchers (e.g. Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report )  and more recently by Volexity   and  Accenture . 

Each  of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise malcode, infection process,  and  known

capabilities of the backdoor.  In addition, a current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection  is

also available.

 

Upon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits CVE­2017­11882  to drop a

malicious  fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll ', which is then injected into

iexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.

Moving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE­2017­1182 ) in

action as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially malicious activity.  This

same process was also flagged in our any.run playback.

Our malware then spins up an instance of 'iexplore.exe' and injects 'NavShExt.dll ' into that process.

 

 

While this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the registry and then

also creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at 'Users\admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\' to

store harvested data.

 

https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection

https://community.rsa.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2371-396682/files-tab.png


 

As the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim data and C2)

through a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.

This traffic was also observed in  NetWitness Packets,  as the  malware verifies the host IP address  prior

to kicking off C2 out to 103.236.150[.]14 , which is likely compromised infrastructure.

https://community.rsa.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2371-396669/elise-firstrun-meta.png


Take note of the cookie set in this HTTP POST, because Lotus Blossom actors go to significant lengths to

protect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption.   The  actual  C2 for Elise takes place over

"cookie" code and (rarely) body content.

 

https://community.rsa.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2371-396665/image+%284%29.png


 

Other infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to populate the host

header, but in every case actually used the same hard­coded IP address, 103.236.150[.]14 .

https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2F103.236.150.14


   

The threat actors actually went to significant efforts to generate these seemingly random domains, likely in

an attempt at obfuscating C2 traffic and avoiding domain­based detection/mitigation.

Based on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we are witnessing

the continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation­states in the Southeast Asian theater.
