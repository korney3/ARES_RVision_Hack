Supply Chain Attack Operation Red Signature Targets
South Korean Organizations

Together with our colleagues at IssueMakersLab, we uncovered
Operation Red Signature, an information theft-driven supply
chain attack targeting organizations in South Korea. We
discovered the attacks around the end of July, while the media
reported the attack in South Korea on August 6.

The threat actors compromised the update server of a remote
support solutions provider to deliver a remote access tool called
9002 RAT to their targets of interest through the update
process. They carried this out by first stealing the company’s certificate then using it to sign the
malware. They also configured the update server to only deliver malicious files if the client is
located in the range of IP addresses of their target organizations.

9002 RAT also installed additional malicious tools: an exploit tool for Internet Information Services

(IIS) 6 WebDav (exploiting CVE-2017-7269) and an SQL database password dumper. These tools
hint at how the attackers are also after data stored in their target’s web server and database.

Figure 1. Operation Red Signature’s attack chain

Here’s how Operation Red Signature works:

1. The code-signing certificate from the remote support solutions provider is stolen. It’s possible
that the certificate was stolen as early as April 2018, as we found a ShiftDoor malware
(4ae4aed210f2b4f75bdb855f6a5c11e625d56de2) on April 8 that was signed with the stolen
certificate.

2. Malicious update files are prepared, signed with the stolen certificate, and uploaded to the
attacker’s server (207[.]148[.]94[.]157).

3. The update server of the company is hacked.

4. The update server is configured to receive an update.zip file from the attackers’ server if a
client is connecting from a specific range of IP addresses belonging to their targeted
organizations.

5. The malicious update.zip file is sent to the client when the remote support program is
executed.

6. The remote support program recognizes the update files as normal and executes the 9002
RAT malware inside it.

7. 9002 RAT downloads and executes additional malicious files from the attackers’ server.

Technical analysis
The update.zip file contains an update.ini file, which has the malicious update configuration that
specifies the remote support solution program to download file000.zip and file001.zip and extract
them as rcview40u.dll and rcview.log to the installation folder.

The program will then execute rcview40u.dll, signed with the stolen certificate, with Microsoft
register server (regsvr32.exe). This dynamic-link library (DLL) is responsible for decrypting the
encrypted rcview.log file and executing it in memory. 9002 RAT is the decrypted rcview.log
payload, which connects to the command-and-control (C&C) server at 66[.]42[.]37[.]101.

Correlating 9002 RAT 
Delving into 9002 RAT, we found that it was compiled on July 17, 2018, and that the configuration
files inside update.zip were created on July 18. Our analysis of an update log file we found reveals
the remote support program’s update process started around 13:35 on July 18, with the 9002 RAT
being downloaded and launched. We also saw the RAT file used for this specific attack was set to
be inactive in August, so we can construe that the RAT’s activity was rather short-lived (from July
18 to July 31).

Additional malware tools
The 9002 RAT also serves as a springboard for delivering additional malware. Most of these are
downloaded as files compressed with the Microsoft cabinet format (.cab). This is most likely done
to avoid detection by antivirus (AV) solutions.

Here’s a list of files that 9002 RAT retrieves and delivers to the affected system:

dsget.exe DsGet View active directory objects

dsquery.exe DsQuery Search for active directory objects

Mitigating supply chain attacks
Supply chain attacks don’t just affect users and businesses — they exploit the trust between
vendors and its clients or customers. By trojanizing software/applications or manipulating the
infrastructures or platforms that run them, supply chain attacks affects the integrity and security of
the goods and services that organizations provide. In healthcare, for instance, where the industry
heavily relies on third-party and cloud-based services, supply chain attacks can risk the privacy of
personally identifiable data and intellectual property, disrupt hospital operations, and even

endanger patient health. And when stacked up with regulations such as the EU General Data
Protection and Regulation (GDPR), the impact can be exacerbated.

Here are some best practices:

Oversee third-party products and services; apart from ensuring the security of the
organization’s own online premises (e.g., patching, authentication mechanisms), security
controls must also be in place in third-party applications being used.

Develop a proactive incident response strategy: Supply chain attacks are often targeted;
organizations must be able to fully understand, manage, and monitor the risks involved in
third-party vendors.

Proactively monitor the network for anomalous activities; firewalls and intrusion detection and
prevention systems help mitigate network-based threats.

Enforce the principle of least privilege: Network segmentation, data categorization, restriction
of system administration tools, and application control help deter lateral movement and
minimize data being exposed.
