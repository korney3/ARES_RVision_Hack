Deep in Thought: Chinese

Targeting of National Security

Think Tanks

For some time now, CrowdStrike has been working with a

number of national security think tanks and human rights

organizations on a pro bono basis to help them with their

security posture. These organizations face some of the most

advanced nation-state adversaries — China, Russia, and Iran,

just to name a few. The individuals who are typically targeted at

these institutions tend to be former senior government officials

who still have lots of contacts within Western governments and,

as such, their private correspondence is of extreme interest to

these attackers. The intelligence services of these nation states

are always on the lookout for any clues they may extract from

such private communications that may give them an advanced

insight into what options government policy makers are

considering on particular issues of interest. At the same time,

with access to the victim email mailboxes, the adversaries can

craft very realistic spear-phishing lures to the government

contacts of targeted think tank personnel by piggybacking on

ongoing real conversations and increasing their chances of a

successful compromise of an official government email account.

Despite this high threat level, these think tanks are organized as

non-profits and often do not have the budgets of commercial

organizations to afford cutting-edge security technologies that

can help them effectively detect these threats. For this reason,

CrowdStrike has provided our Falcon Host endpoint security

technology to many of these organizations at no charge to them

to help detect and attribute these attackers on their networks in

real time, as well as to receive instantaneous full forensic

visibility into their behavior to help with full remediation of any

incident.

Recently, Falcon Host has detected multiple simultaneous

compromises at several national security think tanks from an

actor we call DEEP PANDA, one of the most advanced Chinese

nation-state cyber intrusion groups. For almost three years now,

CrowdStrike has monitored DEEP PANDA targeting critical and

strategic business verticals including: government, defense,

financial, legal, and the telecommunications industries. At the

think tanks, Falcon Host detected targeting of senior individuals

involved in geopolitical policy issues, in particular in the

China/Asia Pacific region. However, last week the unprecedented

real-time visibility provided by Falcon Host into this actor’s

escapades allowed analysts to observe a radical change in

targeting.

This actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of

Southeast Asia policy information, suddenly began targeting

individuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is

undoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the

Levant (ISIS) takeover of major parts of Iraq and the potential

disruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country. In fact,

Iraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports

for China and the country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s

oil sector. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Chinese

government is highly interested in getting a better sense of the

possibility of deeper U.S. military involvement that could help

protect the Chinese oil infrastructure in Iraq. In fact, the shift in

targeting of Iraq policy individuals occurred on June 18, the day

that ISIS began its attack on the Baiji oil refinery.

The Attacks
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology used by these think tanks

consists of a tiny (under 5mb in size) kernel sensor that is

deployed on Windows and Mac servers, desktops, and laptops

and is able to do real-time detection and recording of all

adversary activities taking place on the system. In addition, by

matching the detected activities against our vast Adversary

Intelligence repository, Falcon Host can automatically attribute

the attack to a known adversary group and provide details about

their motivations, capabilities, and key Tactics, Techniques, and

Procedures (TTPs).

Recently, we detected breaches of these networks via the use of

powershell scripts deployed by the adversary as scheduled tasks

on Windows machines. The scripts are passed to the powershell

interpreter through the command line to avoid placement of

extraneous files on the victim machine that could potentially

trigger AV- or Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based detection.

The scripts were scheduled to call back every two hours to the

DEEP PANDA Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.

The script in the command line is base64 encoded, but when

decoded it translates to the following code snippet:

[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback

downloads and runs MadHatter .NET Remote Access Tool (RAT),

one of the favorites of DEEP PANDA. By running them from

memory, it leaves no disk artifacts or host-based IOCs that can

be identified in forensic analysis. This is typical for DEEP PANDA

— stealth is their specialty and they prefer to operate in a way

that leaves a minimal footprint on a victim system and often

allows them to evade detection for a very long time.

For this same reason, DEEP PANDA likes to use webshells to keep

low-footprint persistent access to the victim network, as we’ve

covered in our prior blogs. This case was no exception, and that

initial webshell implant allowed them to execute reconnaissance

commands such as “tasklist,” “net view,” and “net
localgroup administrators,” and then afterward to deploy the
powershell scripts.

The adversary used stolen credentials to mount network shares

via “net use” command. In one case, they brought in Cult of
the Dead Cow’s NetE tool onto the system, but most of the time

they leveraged existing Windows tools and avoided bringing

many new tools into the environment that could make them

noisy and easily detectable by technologies that scan for static

IOCs.

After using compromised credentials to mount file shares, the

adversary was seen compressing data using 7-zip. They were

adding different document types to compressed files by

wildcarding the extensions, such as:

“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk*** 
“\<share name>users<UserName>*rtf *doc”
“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk*** 

“\<share name>users<UserName>*ppt”

They knew exactly which users to target based on their research

policy area, and they rapidly pivoted from China/Asia Pacific

policy experts to Iraq/Middle East policy experts once their

tasking collection requirements changed.

Aggressive Use of Ping to Determine Which Machines of Interest

are Online

On one of the compromised machines, the adversary brought in

a command-line version of RAR archiver that was named

“cftmon.exe” and placed it into “c:windowstemphotfix”
directory. The files were encrypted (both file data and headers)

with “uinfw” password and the archive files were named after
the initials of each user that had been targeted and stored in the

same “c:windowstemphotfix” directory.

For lateral movement, they used WMI to deploy the powershell

scripts remotely and setup scheduled tasks on the remote

systems.

Despite the fact that we were seeing nearly identical TTPs used

across multiple think-tank targets, there is evidence to indicate

that these operations had different individuals behind the

keyboard based on the intricacies of how certain powershell

command lines had been used in each case.

Summary
DEEP PANDA presents a very serious threat not just to think

tanks, but also multinational financial institutions, law firms,

defense contractors, and government agencies. Due to their

stellar operational security and reliance on anti-forensic and

anti-IOC detection techniques, detecting and stopping them is

very challenging without the use of next-generation endpoint

technology like Falcon Host.  Not only was Falcon Host able to

detect this adversary without relying on static signatures or

IOCs, but it was able to provide instantaneous and full forensic

analysis of what had occurred on each of the compromised

endpoints without the need to pull hard drives and do costly and

time-intensive forensics, substantially reducing the time needed

for remediation.

If you are a non-profit think tank or a human rights organization

that would like to take advantage of our no-charge offer of Falcon

Host licenses for your servers and desktops, please email us at

sales@crowdstrike.com with the subject “Non-Profit Falcon
Host Offer.”  

Our Falcon Intelligence subscribers have had access to multiple

reports on the DEEP PANDA actor that includes full analysis of

their attribution, tradecraft and TTPs, as well as detection

indicators and signatures and remediation instructions. And our

CrowdStrike Services has worked on multiple intrusion

investigations related to DEEP PANDA in the last year. If you

would also like to see a demo of Falcon Host or Falcon

Intelligence in action or discuss our Services offerings, please

contact our Sales Team to schedule a personal briefing.

Stay safe and keep a watchful eye on the Pandas, Bears, Kittens,

and other adversaries who are relentlessly preying on your data!
