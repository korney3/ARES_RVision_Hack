GlitchPOS: New PoS malware for sale

Executive summary
 
 
Point-of-sale malware is popular among attackers, as it usually leads to them obtaining
credit card numbers and immediately use that information for financial gain. This type of
malware is generally deployed on retailers' websites and retail point-of-sale locations with
the goal of tracking customers' payment information. If they successfully obtain credit card
details, they can use either the proceeds from the sale of that information or use the credit
card data directly to obtain additional exploits and resources for other malware. Point-of-
sale terminals are often forgotten about in terms of segregation and can represent a soft
target for attackers. Cisco Talos recently discovered a new PoS malware that the attackers
are selling on a crimeware forum. Our researchers also discovered the associated
payloads with the malware, its infrastructure and control panel. We assess with high
confidence that this is not the first malware developed by this actor. A few years ago, they
were also pushing the DiamondFox L!NK botnet. Known as "GlitchPOS," this malware is
also being distributed on alternative websites at a higher price than the original.

The actor behind this malware created a video, which we embedded below, showing how
easy it is to use it. This is a case where the average user could purchase all the tools
necessary to set up their own credit card-skimming botnet.

Packer overview

 
 
A packer developed in VisualBasic protects this malware. It's, on the surface, a fake

game. The user interface of the main form (which is not displayed at the execution)
contains various pictures of cats:

 
The purpose of the packer is to decode a library that's the real payload encoded with the
UPX packer. Once decoded, we gain access to GlitchPOS, a memory grabber developed
in VisualBasic.

 
Payload analysis

 
 
The payload is small and contains only a few functions. It can connect to a command and
control (C2) server to:

 
Register the infected systems

 
Receive tasks (command execution in memory or on disk)
 
Exfiltrate credit card numbers from the memory of the infected system
 
Update the exclusion list of scanned processes
 
Update the "encryption" key
 
Update the User Agent
 
Clean itself

 
Tasks mechanism

The malware receives tasks from the C2 server. Here is the task pane:

 
The commands are executed via a shellcode directly sent by the C2 server. Here is an
example in Wireshark:

 
The shellcode is encoded with base64. In our screenshot, the shellcode is a RunPE:

"Encryption" key

 
 
The "encryption" key of the communication can be updated in the panel. The
communication is not encrypted but simply XORed:

 
Credit card grabber

 
 
The main purpose of this malware is to steal credit card numbers (Track1 and Track2)
from the memory of the infected system. GlitchPOS uses a regular expression to perform
this task:

 
(%B)\d{0,19}\^[\w\s\/]{2,26}\^\d{7}\w*\?

  
The purpose of this regular expression is to detect Track 1 format B

https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/03/glitchpos-new-pos-malware-for-sale.html 5/14

 
Here is an example of Track 1:

  
Cardholder : M. TALOS

  
Card number*: 1234 5678 9012 3445

  
Expiration: 01/99

  
%B1234567890123445^TALOS/M.

 
 
;\d{13,19}=\d{7}\w*\?

  
The purpose of this regular expression is to detect Track 2

  
Here is an example of Track 2 based on the previous example:

  
;1234567890123445=99011200XXXX00000000?*

If a match is identified in memory, the result is sent to the C2 server. The malware
maintains an exclusion list provided by the server. Here is the default list: chrome, firefox,
iexplore, svchost, smss, csrss, wininit, steam, devenv, thunderbird, skype, pidgin,
services, dwn, dllhost, jusched, jucheck, lsass, winlogon, alg, wscntfy, taskmgr, taskhost,
spoolsv, qml, akw.

Linked with DiamondFox L!NK botnet
 

 
Author: Edbitss

 
 
The first mention of GlitchPOS was on Feb. 2, 2019 on a malware forum:

 
Edbitss is allegedly the developer of the DiamondFox L!NK botnet in 2015/2016 and 2017
as explained in a report by CheckPoint.

The developer created this video to promote GlitchPOS, as well. In this video, you can see
the author set up the malware and capture the data from a swiped card. We apologize for
the quality, shakiness, music, and generally anything else with this video, again, it's not
ours.

The built malware is sold for $250, the builder $600 and finally, the gate address change is
charged at $80.

 
Panel similarities

https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/03/glitchpos-new-pos-malware-for-sale.html 9/14

In addition to the malware language (VisualBasic), we identified similarities between the
DiamondFox panel and the GlitchPOS panel. In this section, the DiamondPOS
screenshots come from the CheckPoint report mentioned previously.

Both dashboards' world map are similar (image, code and color):
 

 
The author used the same terminology such ask "Clients" or "Tasks" on the left menu:

https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BTQZtPy6U1g/XIdtsROjBJI/AAAAAAAAApU/fwwrmtcBaF8c3Uge-pKj56l4D2nmsJkEACLcBGAs/s1600/image4.png

https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/03/glitchpos-new-pos-malware-for-sale.html 10/14

 
The icons are the same too in both panels, as well as the infected machine list (starting
with the HWID). The PHP file naming convention is similar to DiamondFox, too.

The author clearly reused code from DiamondFox panel on the GlitchPOS panel.

 
Comparison of GlitchPOS and the DiamondFox POS module

 
 
In 2017, the DiamondFox malware included a POS plugin. We decided to check if this
module was the same as GlitchPOS, but it is not. For DiamondFox, the author decided to
use the leaked code of BlackPOS to build the credit card grabber. On GlitchPOS, the
author developed its own code to perform this task and did not use the previously leaked
code.

 
Bad guys are everywhere
 
 
It's interesting to see that someone else attempted to push the same malware 25 days
after edbitss on an alternative forum:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7oxAHPyZkg4/XIdtw3lWDuI/AAAAAAAAApc/ITeiEFaLKtgABr1CBuULpd4fGMZOo-K6wCLcBGAs/s1600/image21.png

This attacker even tried to cash in by increasing some prices.
 
Some members even attempted to
call out the unscrupulous behaviour:

 
With the different information we have, we think that Chameleon101 has taken the
previous malware created by Edbitss to sell it on an alternative forum and with a higher
price.

Conclusion
 
 
This investigation shows us that POS malware is still attractive and some people are still
working on the development of this family of malware. We can see that edbitss developed
malware years even after being publicly mentioned by cybersecurity companies. He left
DiamondFox to switch on a new project targeting point-of-sale. The sale opened a few
weeks ago, so we don't know yet how many people bought it or use it. We also see that
bad guys steal the work of each other and try to sell malware developed by other
developers at a higher price. The final word will be a quote from Edbitss on a DiamondFox
screenshot published by himself "In the future, even bank robbers will be replaced."
