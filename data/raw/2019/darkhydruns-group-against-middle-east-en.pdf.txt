Background

360 Threat Intelligence Center captured several lure Excel documents written in Arabic in January 9,

2019. A backdoor dropped by macro in the lure documents can communicate with C2 server through DNS

tunnel, as well as Google Drive API.

We confirmed that this is a DarkHydrus Group’s new attack targeting Middle East region. In July 2018,

Palo Alto disclosed DarkHydrus Group which showed its special interest to governments in Middle East[1].

Prior to that report, we published detail analysis on malware exploiting CVE-2018-8414 vulnerability

(remote code execution in SettingContent-ms), which is believed a work of DarkHydrus[2].

Timeline

Timeline of activities of DarkHydrus Group:

Kaspersky named “LazyMeerkat” to this APT group. [4]

Sample Analysis

Dropper（Macros）

MD5 5c3f96ade0ea67eef9d25161c64e6f3e

Filename xlsm（indexes. xlsm）.الفهارس

MD5 8dc9f5450402ae799f5f8afd5c0a8352

Filename xlsm（viewing. xlsm）.االطالع

This malware is a lure Excel document with name ‘الفهارس.xlsm’. When it is opened, embedded VBA
macro is trigged to run. That macro drops 12-B-366.txt to ‘%TEMP%’ directory first, then leverages

regsvr32.exe to run 12-B-366.txt

12-B-366.txt is a HTA (HTML application) file, which will drop a PowerShell script to %TEMP%\\

WINDOWSTEMP.ps1

Finally, the PowerShell script drops %TEMP%\\OfficeUpdateService.exe for execution by extracting

Based64-encoded content.

Backdoor（OfficeUpdateService.exe）

MD5 b108412f1cdc0602d82d3e6b318dc634

Filename OfficeUpdateService.exe

PDB path
C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Relea

se\DNSProject.pdb

This backdoor is written in C#：

The PDB path has a project name ‘DNSProject’, which illustrates that the malware may leverage some

DNS techniques to achieve its goal.

C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio

2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Release\DNSProject.pdb

The backdoor checks if ‘st:off’ and ‘pd:off’ is given as paramters. If ‘st:off’ presents, no persistence

entry is added; PDF file is not dropped if ‘pd:off’ exists. Then it detects existence of virtual machine and

sandbox before malicious payload is triggered.

The backdoor will send collected information to C2 server through DNS tunnel. queryTypesTest function

is created for DNS tunnel communication.

Then, the backdoor tries to retrieve commands from C2 server via DNS tunnel, then through HTTP if

failed.

After C2 commands is retrieved successfully, commands are dispatched by taskHandler. 

DNS Tunnel

DNS tunnel is a C2 communication technique in which malware send data and retrieve commands by

DNS query packets. This technique is very effective since most gateways or firewalls allow both ingress

and egress DNS traffic.

If C2 server is assigned in the format of IP address in malware body, malware can contact C2 directly.

But OfficeUpdateService.exe backdoor has C2 server in the format of DNS name, which requires a DNS

resolution to C2 domain name first. To do that, the backdoor queries C2 domain in specific name server.

Then the backdoor communicates C2 server in DNS tunnel.

C2 domain names are following：

Name Server

Malware sends DNS queries to these two name servers for C2 domain name resolution:

‘tvs1.trafficmanager.live’ and ‘tvs2.trafficmanager.live’

Malware uses nslookup to send out DNS query, with following parameters: ‘timeout’ and ‘q’ for DNS

record type

C&C Commands

To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses different regular

expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS A record, the malware will use following

regular expression:

Malware will retrieve a process ID as victim ID, then treats victim ID as subdomain name in C2

communication.

C2 commands are parsed out by regular expressions based on DNS record types.

We manually send out a DNS TXT query with victim ID as illustration.

A domain name ‘ajpinc.akamaiedge.live’ is created. In subdomain ‘ajpinc’, ‘a’ means this is the first

request, and ‘c’ is the character for string end, while ‘jpin’ is process ID. Then, we send DNS query by

using nslookup command as following

The malware will use following regular expression to parse out command, ([\\w+).

(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live](file://w+).

(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live)).

Finally, system configuration is sent to C2 server in DNS protocol.

Communication Rule

This malware uses following types of DNS record

A

AAAA

AC

CNAME

TXT

SRV

SOA

MX

To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses different regular

expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS AC record, the malware will use following

regular expression:

Following regular expression is for commands in DNS AAAA records,

1/17/2019 360威胁情报中心

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/latest-target-attack-of-darkhydruns-group-against-middle-east-en/ 14/20

And there is one regular expression for several DNS record types, including CNAME, SRV, SOA,





1/17/2019 360威胁情报中心

https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/latest-target-attack-of-darkhydruns-group-against-middle-east-en/ 15/20

Breakdown of regular expressions are as following,

Types of DNS record Regular expressions

A Address:\\s+(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)

AC ([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)

AAAA Address:\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\w|:]+){1,8})

CNAME、TXT、SRV、SOA、MX

([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)

and

(\\w+).(<C2DOMIAN>)

However, the malware will cancel operation if commands is matched by following regular expression:

"216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|window

supdate.microsoft.com|update.microsoft.com"

Attribution

We found some traces which lead us to believe that DarkHydrus is behind this attack.

Samples with DNS Tunnel Function

Similar to the malware disclosed by Palo Alto[2], both malware use DNS tunnel technique:

Sandbox detection and Backdoor Capability

The new malware has very similar code of detection to sandbox and virtual machine as previous

DarkHydrus samples

Both samples have very similar code and functionality:

Pivot

One interesting finding is that, there is one Twitter user Steve Williams with handle name

@darkhydrus2. It’s coincident that both ‘darkhydrus’ (APT group name) and ‘Williams’ (user name in PDB

path) found in this Twitter user.

Summary

In recent APT incidents, more and more threat actors tend to adopt Office VBA macro instead of Office

0day vulnerability in the consideration of cost reduction. It is recommended that users avoid to open

documents from untrusted sources. And Office macro should be disabled by default.

Products of 360 ESG can protect users from this new malware, including 360 Threat Intelligence

Platform, SkyEye APT Detection, 360 NGSOC.
