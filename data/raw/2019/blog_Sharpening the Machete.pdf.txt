Sharpening the Machete
welivesecurity.com/2019/08/05/sharpening-machete-cyberespionage

Latin America is often overlooked when it comes to persistent threats and groups with politically
motivated targets. There is, however, an ongoing case of cyberespionage against high-profile
organizations that has managed to stay under the radar. The group behind these attacks has
stolen gigabytes of confidential documents, mostly from military organizations. It is still very active
at the time of this publication, regularly introducing changes to its malware, infrastructure and
spearphishing campaigns.

ESET has been tracking a new version of Machete (the group’s Python-based toolset) that was
first seen in April 2018. While the main functionality of the backdoor remains the same as in
previous versions, it has been extended with new features over the course of a year.

Targets
From the end of March up until the end of May 2019, ESET researchers observed that there were
more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the C&C server. This amounts to
gigabytes of data being uploaded every week. More than half of the compromised computers
were in the Venezuelan military forces, whereas the others were related to education, police, and
foreign affairs sectors. This extends to other countries in Latin America, with the Ecuadorean
military being another organization highly targeted with the Machete malware. The distribution of
this malware in these countries is shown in Figure 1.

Malware operators
Machete’s operators use effective spearphishing techniques. Their long run of attacks, focused on
Latin American countries, has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the
years. They know their targets, how to blend into regular communications, and which documents
are of the most value to steal. Not only does Machete exfiltrate common office suite documents,
but also specialized file types used by geographic information systems (GIS) software. The group
is interested in files that describe navigation routes and positioning using military grids.

The Machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims, and these change from
target to target. These emails contain either a link to, or an attachment of, a compressed self-
extracting archive that runs the malware and opens a document that serves as a decoy.

Figure 2 is a typical PDF file displayed to a potential victim during compromise. To trick
unsuspecting targets, Machete operators use real documents they have previously stolen; Figure
2 is a classified military document that is dated May 21 , 2019, the same day the related .zip file
was first sent to targets. ESET has seen more cases like this where stolen documents dated on
one particular day were bundled with malware and used on the same day as lures to compromise
new victims.

Figure 2. Decoy (PDF file) in one of the Machete downloaders (blurred)

The kind of documents used as decoys are sent and received legitimately several times a day by
the group’s targets. For example, Radiogramas are documents used for communication in the
Venezuelan military forces. Attackers take advantage of that, along with their knowledge of
military jargon and etiquette, to craft very convincing phishing emails.

Main characteristics
The Machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to its malware since a new
version was released in April 2018. Previous versions were described by Kaspersky in 2014 and
Cylance in 2017. In Figure 3 we show the components for the new version of the Machete
malware.

Figure 3. Components of Machete

The first part of the attack consists of a downloader that comes as a self-extracting archive, made
with 7z SFX Builder. Once the archive is unpacked by the self-extraction code, the extractor
opens a PDF or Microsoft Office file that serves as a decoy, and then runs the downloader
executable from the archive. That executable is another self-extracting file that contains the actual
downloader binary (a py2exe component) and a configuration file with the downloader’s target
URL as an encrypted string.

All download URLs we have seen are at either Dropbox or Google Docs. The files at these URLs
have all been self-extracting (RAR SFX) archives containing encrypted configuration and py2exe
backdoor components. Since May 2019, however, the Machete operators stopped using

The py2exe binaries can be decompiled to obtain Python code. All of the components –
downloaders and backdoors – are obfuscated with pyobfuscate. This has been used in previous
versions of the malware as well. Figure 4 shows part of one of these obfuscated scripts.

Figure 4. Script obfuscated with pyobfuscate

Since August 2018, the Machete components have been delivered with an extra layer of
obfuscation. The scripts now contain a block of zlib-compressed, base64-encoded text which,
after being decoded, produces a script like the one in Figure 4. This first layer of obfuscation is
produced using pyminifier with the -gzip parameter.

Backdoor components
Machete’s dropper is a RAR SFX executable. Three py2exe components are dropped:
GoogleCrash.exe, Chrome.exe and GoogleUpdate.exe. A single configuration file, jer.dll, is
dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings. A
schema summarizing the components is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Backdoor py2exe components of Machete

GoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the other two
components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.

The Chrome.exe component is responsible for collection of data from the victimized computer. It
can:

Take screenshots
Log keystrokes
Access the clipboard
AES-encrypt and exfiltrate documents
Detect newly inserted drives and copy files
Execute other binaries downloaded from the C&C server
Retrieve specific files from the system
Retrieve user profile data from several browsers
Collect geolocation of victims and information about nearby Wi-Fi networks
Perform physical exfiltration to removable drives

The Machete operators are interested in obtaining specific file types from their targets. Apart from
Microsoft Office documents, drives are searched for:

Backup files
Database files
Cryptographic keys (PGP)
OpenOffice documents
Vector images
Files for geographic information systems (topographic maps, navigation routes, etc.)

Regarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and
sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation
coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi
access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude coordinates to build a Google Maps
URL. Part of the code is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Code for geolocation

The advantage of using Mozilla Location Service is that it permits geolocation without an actual
GPS and can be more accurate than other methods. For example, an IP address can be used to
obtain an approximate location, but it is not so accurate. On the other hand, if there is available
data for the area, Mozilla Location Service can provide information such as in which building the
target is located.

The GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server.
The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name, username and
password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP
communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.

This component uploads encrypted files to different subdirectories on the C&C server, but it also
retrieves specific files that have been put on the server by the Machete operators. This way, the
malware can have its configuration, malicious binaries and file listings updated, but can also
download and execute other binaries.

In conclusion
The Machete group is operating more strongly than ever, even after researchers have published
technical descriptions and indicators of compromise for this malware. ESET has been tracking
this threat for months and has observed several changes, sometimes within weeks.

At the time of this publication, the latest change introduced six backdoor components, which are
no longer py2exe executables. Python scripts for malicious components, an original executable
for Python 2.7, and all libraries used are packed into a self-extracting file.

Various artifacts that we have seen in Machete’s code and the underlying infrastructure lead us to
think that this is a Spanish-speaking group. The presence of code to exfiltrate data to removable
drives when there is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate that Machete
operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries, although we cannot be certain.

A full and comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) can be found in the full white
paper and on GitHub. ESET detects this threat as a variant of Python/Machete.

For a detailed analysis of the backdoor, refer to our white paper Machete just got sharper:
