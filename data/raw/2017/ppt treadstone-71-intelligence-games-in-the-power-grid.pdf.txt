Delta Elektronics is a legitimate reseller of Delta Electronics Taiwan hardware 
in business for profit.

Hypothesis One

Delta Elektronics is a fake company set up by a nation state in collusion with 
criminal elements in order to generate revenue and launder money.

Hypothesis Two

Delta Elektronics is a fake company established with the support of the 
government used to sell legitimate SCADA hardware with malware backdoors 
in the PLC software for later exploitation.

Hypothesis Three

Delta Elektronics is a front company used by Russian intelligence/nation state 
actors and oligarchs to infect energy organizations for present day cyber 
espionage and targeted sabotage while generating money for oligarchs.

Hypothesis Four

Delta Elektronics is a front company used by a criminal group to either 
defraud energy companies by providing fraudulent equipment or skim off the 
top.

Hypothesis  Five

Possible Hypotheses

Treadstone 71 Proprietary and Confidential



Energetic Bear started after learning about PLCs from Delta Elektronics as 
part of a Russian hybrid warfare program and is now fully integrated with 
Delta Elektronics in a physical/cyber focused effort.

Hypothesis Six

Energetic Bear performs full-scope cyber operations from reconnaissance 
and data collection, intelligence production and analysis, software 
obfuscation, infection, modification, and expansion as part of the Russian 
government’s hybrid warfare efforts used to destabilize hostile regimes.

Hypothesis Seven

Energetic Bear is a criminal enterprise operating at the periphery of the 
Russian government for monetary gain.

– "The recognition of our achievements - is a definite 
indicator of a good job agencies in this area, because the 
work of firefighters and rescuers specifically associated with 
risk to life and is always traumatic. This is a huge incentive 
to continue to work in this direction at the highest level. Life

employer, it can not be measured by any awards. “

• In "Tsentrospas-Yugoria" today, 9 branches, which cover 158

BlackEnergy

Identified several years ago, BlackEnergy is a Trojan malware designed to launch distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, download custom spam, and banking information-stealer
plugins.

• BlackEnergy malware was known to have been used to deliver KillDisk, a feature that could render 
systems unusable and could obliterate critical components on an infected system.  

• It was reported to have possessed remarkable functions that could place Industrial Control Systems 
(ICS) at risk. 

• An attack scenario involves a target receiving an email that contains a malicious attachment. 
• The attacker spoofs the sender address in order to appear to be coming from Rada (the Ukrainian 

parliament). 
• Once the target opens the attachment, the victim is asked to run the macro in the document.

Analysis of Delta Elektronics 
and BlackEnergy

Embedded Malware 

Evidence 1 (E1)

E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6

We believe with moderate confidence that Delta Elektronics (DE) is likely a front company, and the
equipment purchased from DE is vulnerable to supply chain threats. The possible supply chain threats
introduce vulnerabilities impacting organizational supply chain functions and daily operations.

Evidence 2 (E2)

Evidence 5 (E5)

Capabilities – org
Structure – geo 
political tied to 
cyber

Evidence 6 (E6)

We believe with moderate confidence that Delta Elektronics (DE) and BlackEnergy are part of an integrated,
hybrid warfare effort targeting actual and perceived threats to the Russian Federation. It is likely the
behaviors exhibited are part of strategic positioning, maturation of the program, and demonstrated success
of Russian cyber maskirovka and dezinformatsiya.

Final Analysis

Message and 
Storyline

We estimate the 
likelihood of Russian 
complicity to be 
probable. The evidence 
collected and subsequent 
analysis using structured 
techniques does not 
render our judgment to 
be fact or a certainty, 
however, and such 
judgments still carry a 
risk of being wrong.

Although there is an 
absence of evidence 
supporting a direct 
alignment of BlackEnergy, 
Dragonfly, and Delta 
Elektronics, the similarity 
of the targets, assumed 
adversary intent, the 
behaviors and methods of 
deception are consistent 
with nation-state actions.

Some of the information is fragmented and poorly corroborated to make solid analytic 
inferences. Some sources are difficult to validate. Typical compartmentalization of 
intelligence activities may be used to ensure complete lack of awareness of activities at 
the operational level. Leadership over the groups behind BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and 
Delta Elektronics may be limited in a “Dunbar’s number” method of maintain secrecy.

Presentation Notes
We cannot rule out direct Russian involvement based upon previous judgments and behaviors by the Russian government and Russian proxies. Historical profiling of Russian activities indicates at a minimum, their participation in these activities. Adversary intent, whether it is BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, or Delta Elektronics combined with expert capabilities enables a high probability of threat. Additionally, the probability of threat occurrence in unison with the success of the actions and the overall impact(s) when examined considering the Ukrainian attacks, represents a high level of risk. The use of hybrid warfare methods in combination with constantly moving attack vectors makes difficult, attribution and methods of defense. The adversary(s) behind the actions demonstrate information superiority while revealing behaviors with similarities. Continued data and information collection for analysis is required but serves as a double-edged sword. This sword ensures we continue to churn examining multiple different versions of information using limited resources while missing the primary intent and potentially simple conclusion as to the intent and success of the adversary(s).
