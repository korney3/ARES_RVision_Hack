The DarkHotel threat actors have been known to operate for a decade now, targeting thousands of
businesses across the world via Wi-Fi infrastructure in hotels. Blending whaling (high-level spear phishing)
techniques with advanced malware and other complex attack avenues (such as digital certificate
factoring), the threat actors have been able to run their business undisturbed for years, except for the few
times when samples of DarkHotel malware got documented in blog posts by threat researchers.

Our threat researchers have come across a very particular DarkHotel attack known as Inexsmar, which
appears to mark a significant departure from the APT group’s traditional modus operandi. This sample
dates back to September 2016 and seems to be used in a campaign that targets political figures rather
than the usual  corporate research and development personnel, CEOs and other senior corporate officials.

This attack uses a new payload delivery mechanism rather than the consacrated zero-day exploitation
techniques, blending social engineering with a relatively complex Trojan to infect its selected pool of
victims.

Guys,

Can you please do the industry a favour and redeem some credibility?

When you put IoCs into a report, don't make is to that you cannot cut-and-paste the checksums and alike. Doing this
is just plain sh*tty. Why make people type IoCs in by hand? Unless of course you intention it to sell them as a
premium service. In which case, don't put them in the report at all. Sadly, this isn't the first time I've flagged this up.

Hey there,

Let me rephrase your previous message a little.

"Hey guys! I was looking into your research and I noticed that one can't copy and paste the indicators of compromise
at the end of the paper and I thought I'd let you know. Maybe your PDF file is not compatible with other clients or
maybe your guy who laid this out forgot to check a box somewhere to export it as text, not as images. Anyway, can
you do me a solid and export this in a copy-pasta-friendly manner, cause it's really painful to spell a SHA1 out".

And I'd be like, "Yeah, sure buddy, thanks for letting us know. By the way, here are the IoCs, enjoy!"
