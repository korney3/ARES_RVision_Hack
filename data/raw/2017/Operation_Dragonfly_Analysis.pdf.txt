On September 6, Symantec published details of the Dragon�y campaign, which targeted dozens of energy companies
throughout 2017. This attack was e�ectively Dragon�y 2.0, an update to a campaign that began in 2014.

Moving beyond our 2014 analysis of Dragon�y, (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/operation-dragon�y-
imperils-industrial-protocol/) our current focus looks at the attack’s indicators to determine whether we can glean any
further information regarding the source and possible motivations of those behind the campaign. The campaign targets
energy companies around the world by leveraging spear-phishing emails that, once successful, allow the attackers to
download Trojan software. The Trojans provide access to the victims’ systems and networks.

Going Beyond Energy

Although initial reports showed Dragon�y attacks targeting the energy sector, investigations by McAfee Labs and the
Advanced Threat Research team uncovered related attacks targeting the pharmaceutical, �nancial, and accounting
industries. Everything about this campaign points to a well-prepared assault that carefully considers each target, and
conducts reconnaissance before taking any measures to exploit compromised targets.

We saw the group use several techniques to get a foothold in victims’ networks, including spear phishing, watering holes,
and exploits of supply-chain technologies via previous campaigns. By compromising well-established software
vulnerabilities and embedding within them “backdoor” malware, the victims think they are installing software from a
trusted vendor, while unaware of the supply-side compromise.

Once the attackers have a foothold, they create or gain user accounts to operate stealthily. Using the remote-desktop
protocol to hop among internal or external systems, they connect either to a control server if the risk is minimal or use an
internal compromised server to conduct operations.

The last wave of attacks used several backdoors and utilities. In analyzing the samples, we compared these with McAfee’s
threat intelligence knowledge base of attack artifacts.

One of the starting points was a Trojan in the 2017 campaign with the following hashes:

MD5: da9d8c78efe0c6c8be70e6b857400fb1
SHA-256: fc54d8afd2ce5cb6cc53c46783bf91d0dd19de604308d536827320826bc36ed9

Comparing this code, we discovered another sample from the group that was used in a July 2013 attack
(https://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2014/07/Kaspersky_Lab_crouching_yeti_appendixes_eng_�nal.pdf):

MD5: 4bfdda1a5f21d56afdc2060b9ce5a170
SHA-256: 07bd08b07de611b2940e886f453872aa8d9b01f9d3c61d872d6cfe8cde3b50d4
Filename: �.exe

The �le was downloaded after a Java exploit executed on the victim’s machine, according to the 2013 attack report. After
analyzing the 2013 sample, we noticed that some of the executable’s resources were in Russian.

Comparing the code, we �nd the 2017 sample has a large percentage of the same code as the backdoor used in the 2013
attacks. Further, some code in the 2017 backdoor is identical to code in the application TeamViewer, a legitimate remote
administration tool used by many around the world. By incorporating the code and in-memory execution, the attackers
avoid detection and leave no trace on disk.

The correlating hash we discovered that contained the same TeamViewer code was reported by Crysys, a Hungarian
security company. In their report on about ‘“TeamSpy,” (http://www.crysys.hu/teamspy/teamspy.pdf) they mentioned the
hash we correlated as well: 708ceccae2c27e32637fd29451aef4a5. This particular sample had the following compile date
details: 2011:09:07 – 09:27:58+01:00

The TeamSpy attacks were originally aimed at political and human right activists living in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and eastern European countries. Although the report attributes the attacks
to a threat actor or actors and shared tactics and procedures, the motivations behind TeamSpy appear similar to those of
the Dragon�y group. With identical code reuse, could the TeamSpy campaign be the work of Dragon�y?

But that’s not all of interest. We also discovered that the 2017 sample contained code blocks associated with another
interesting malware family: BlackEnergy. Let’s look at an example of the code similarities we discovered:

https://cdn.securelist.com/files/2014/07/Kaspersky_Lab_crouching_yeti_appendixes_eng_final.pdf
http://www.crysys.hu/teamspy/teamspy.pdf


A BlackEnergy sample from 2016 (at left) alongside a Dragon�y sample from 2017.

Self-deleting code is very common in malware, but it is usually implemented by creating a batch �le and executing the
batch instead of directly calling the delete command, as we see in the preceding examples.

The BlackEnergy sample used in our comparison was captured in the Ukraine on October 31, 2015, and was mentioned in
our post (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/updated-blackenergy-trojan-grows-more-powerful/) on the
evolution of the BlackEnergy Trojan. It is remarkable that this piece of code is almost identical in both samples, and
suggests a correlation between the BlackEnergy and Dragon�y campaigns.

Actor Sophistication

Our analysis of this attack tells a story about the actors’ capability and skills. Their attack precision is very good; they know
whom and what to attack, using a variety of e�orts. Their focus is on Windows systems and they use well-known practices
to gather information and credentials. From our research, we have seen the evolution of the code in their backdoors and
the reuse of code in their campaigns.

How well do the actors cover their tracks? We conclude they are fairly sophisticated in hiding details of their attacks, and in
some cases in leaving details behind to either mislead or make a statement. We rate threat actors by scoring them in
di�erent categories; we have  mentioned a few. The Dragon�y group is in the top echelon of targeting attackers; it is
critical that those in the targeted sectors be aware of them.

The Dragon�y group is most likely after intellectual property or insights into the sector they target, with the ability to take
o�ensive disruptive and destructive action, as was reported (http://www.silicon.co.uk/security/blackenergy-trojan-ukraine-
power-183050?inf_by=5a291109671db830108b4a17) in the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid by a BlackEnergy
malware family.

 

We would like to thank the team at Intezer for their assistance and support during our research.
