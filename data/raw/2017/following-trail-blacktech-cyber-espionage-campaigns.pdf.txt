BlackTech is a cyber espionage group operating against targets in
East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and occasionally, Japan and Hong
Kong. Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their
C&C servers, BlackTech’s campaigns are likely designed to steal
their target’s technology.

Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped
us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three
seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and
of late, Waterbear.

Over the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the
trade—and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and
Waterbear may actually be operated by the same group.

PLEAD
PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012,
it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations.  PLEAD’s toolset
includes the self-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing
emails to deliver and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage
services. Some of the cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points
for exfiltrated documents stolen by DRIGO.

PLEAD’s installers are disguised as documents using the right-to-left-override (RTLO) technique to
obfuscate the malware’s filename. They are mostly accompanied by decoy documents to further trick
users. We’ve also seen PLEAD use exploits for these vulnerabilities:

CVE-2015-5119, patched by Adobe last July, 2015

CVE-2012-0158, patched by Microsoft last April, 2012

CVE-2014-6352, patched by Microsoft last October, 2014

CVE-2017-0199, patched by Microsoft last April, 2017

PLEAD also dabbled with a short-lived, fileless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for
a Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) that was leaked during the Hacking Team breach.

This virtual server will beused either as a C&C server or an HTTP server that delivers PLEAD malware to their targets.PLEAD also uses CVE-2017-7269, a buffer overflow vulnerability Microsoft Internet InformationServices (IIS) 6.0 to compromise the victim’s server. This is another way for them to establish a newC&C or HTTP server.Figure 2: One of the methods PLEAD operators use to distribute their malwarePLEAD’s backdoor can:Harvest saved credentials from browsers and email clients like OutlookList drives, processes, open windows, and filesOpen remote ShellUpload target fileExecute applications via ShellExecute APIDelete target filePLEAD also uses the document-targeting exfiltration tool DRIGO, which mainly searches the infectedmachine for documents. Each copy of DRIGO contains a refresh token tied to specific Gmail accountsused by the attackers, which are in turn linked to a Google Drive account. The stolen files are uploadedto these Google Drives, where the attackers can harvest them.Shrouded CrossbowThis campaign, first observed in 2010, is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how itappeared to have purchased the source code of the BIFROST backdoor, which the operators enhancedand created other tools from. Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized agencies and governmentcontractors as well as enterprises in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financialindustries.Shrouded Crossbow employs three BIFROST-derived backdoors: BIFROSE, KIVARS, and XBOW. Like
PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize
the RTLO technique and accompanied by decoy documents.

BIFROSE, known for evading detection by communicating with its C&C servers via Tor protocol, also
has a version targeting UNIX-based operating systems, which are usually used in servers,
workstations, and mobile devices. KIVARS has less functionality than BIFROSE, but its modular

structure made it easier to maintain. KIVARS enabled attackers to download and execute files, list
drives, uninstall malware service, take screenshots, activate/deactivate keylogger, show/hide active
windows, and trigger mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. A 64-bit version of KIVARS also emerged to
keep pace with the popularity of 64-bit systems. XBOW’s capabilities are derived from BIFROSE and
KIVARS; Shrouded Crossbow gets its name from its unique mutex format.

Waterbear
Waterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s
capability to equip additional functions remotely.

Waterbear similarly employs a modular approach to its malware. A loader component executable will
connect to the C&C server to download the main backdoor and load it in memory. A later version of this
malware appeared and used patched server applications as its loader component, while the main
backdoor is either loaded from an encrypted file or downloaded from the C&C server.

The tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets’ environment. It’s possible attackers
used Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access
into the targets’ systems.

All Roads Lead to BlackTech
Based on the use of the same C&C servers, the campaigns’ coordinated efforts, and similarities in
tools, techniques, and objectives, we can conclude that they are operated by the same group. It is not
uncommon, for instance, for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run
multiple campaigns. While most of the campaigns’ attacks are conducted separately, we’ve seen
apparently joint operations conducted in phases that entail the work of different teams at each point in
the infection chain.

Use of the Same C&C Servers. In several instances, we found the campaigns’ malware
communicating with the same C&C servers. In targeted attacks, C&C servers are typically not shared
with other groups. Here are some of the C&C servers we found that are shared by the campaigns:

C&C Server PLEAD Shrouded Crossbow Waterbear

itaiwans[.]com Yes No Yes

microsoftmse[.]com Yes Yes No

211[.]72[.]242[.]120 Yes Yes No

Table 1: C&C servers shared by PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear

Additionally, the IP 211[.]72 [.]242[.]120 is one of the hosts for the domain microsoftmse[.]com, which
has been used by several KIVARS variants.

Joint Operations. We also found incidents where the backdoors were used on the same targets. While
it’s possible for separate groups to attack at the same time, we can construe at they are at least
working together:

Samples from the same

Table 3: Incidents where PLEAD, KIVARS, and Waterbear were used on the same target

Similarities between tools and techniques. PLEAD and KIVARS, for instance, share the use of
RTLO techniques to disguise their installers as documents. Both also use decoy documents to make
the RTLO attack more convincing. Another similarity is the use of a small loader component to load
encrypted backdoors into memory.

Similar Objectives. The ulterior motive of these campaigns is to steal important documents from their
victims; initial recipients of their attacks are not always their primary target. For instance, we saw
several decoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target. This
indicates that document theft is most likely the first phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to
the intended target. While PLEAD and KIVARS are most likely to be used in first phase attacks,
Waterbear can be seen as a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of

Based on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns, we can get a clearer view of who they’re
targeting and compromising, the purpose of their campaigns, and when they take place. Below are
some of the categories or labels of the stolen documents:

Enterprises Need to be Proactive
PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear are still actively mounting their campaigns against its
targets, which is why organizations must proactively secure their perimeter.

IT/system administrators and information security professionals can consider making a checklist of
what to look out for in the network for any signs of anomalies and suspicious behavior that can indicate
intrusions. Adopting best practices and employing multilayered security mechanisms and strategies
against targeted attacks are also recommended. Network traffic analysis, deployment of firewalls and
intrusion detection and prevention systems, network segmentation, and data categorization are just
some of them.
