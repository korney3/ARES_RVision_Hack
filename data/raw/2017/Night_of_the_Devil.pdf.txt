Night of the Devil: Ransomware or wiper? A look into targeted attacks in Japan
using MBR-ONI

For several months Cybereason has been following the concerning rise of ONI, a family

of ransomware involved in targeted attacks against Japanese companies. We suspect

that the ONI ransomware was used as a wiper to cover up an elaborate hacking

operation. These targeted attacks lasted between three to nine months and all ended

with an attempt to encrypt hundreds of machines at once. Forensic artifacts found on

the compromised machines show that the attackers made a significant attempt to cover

their operation.  

During our investigation, Cybereason discovered a new bootkit ransomware dubbed

“MBR-ONI” used by the same threat actor in conjunction with ONI. This bootkit

ransomware is based on DiskCryptor, a legitimate disk encryption utility, the very same

tool whose code was found in the recently discovered Bad Rabbit ransomware.  

While the ransomware discussed in this report is specific to Japan, targeted attacks

involving ransomware/wipers have been on the rise across the world in recent years,

which is why we’re releasing this research. We believe that sharing information on this

operation can benefit the entire security community.

The Japanese security community has discussed ONI in blog posts, and while

suspicions were raised that it might be involved in targeted attacks, no further context

was provided at the time. Cybereason researchers, though, were able to link ONI to

targeted attacks in Japan and provide more context around the ransomware.  

In addition, Cybereason discovered MBR-ONI, a bootkit ransomware, which modifies

the MBR and encrypts disk partitions. We concluded that both ONI and MBR-ONI stem

from the same threat actor since they were used in conjunction in the same targeted

attacks and their ransom note contains the same email address.

Autopsy of ONI targeted attacks
Cybereason Japan analyzed a few instances of attacks that used the ONI ransomware

against Japanese companies across different industries. These attacks share a very

similar modus operandi:

https://www.cylance.com/ja_jp/blog/jp-oni-ransomware-globeimposter.html
https://www.cybersecurity.co.jp/incident/oni%E6%8B%A1%E5%BC%B5%E5%AD%90-%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A0%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2/
https://www.cybereason.com/


1. Penetration vector: Spear-phishing emails carrying weaponized Office documents,

which ultimately drop the Ammyy Admin RAT.

2. Reconnaissance, credential theft and lateral movement: Using the Ammyy Admin RAT

and other hacking tools, the attackers mapped out the internal networks, harvested

credentials and moved laterally, ultimately compromising critical assets, including the

domain controller (DC), to gain full control over the network.

3. Scorched earth policy: Log deletion and distribution of ONI via rogue GPO: During

the attack’s last stage, a rogue group policy was created and pushed across the

organization. Using autorun persistence, the group policy would fetch a batch script

from the DC server, which would wipe Windows’ event logs clean in attempt to cover

the attackers’ tracks and avoid log-based detection. In addition, the ONI binary file was

also copied from the DC and executed, encrypting a large array of files.

4. MBR-ONI used against critical assets: While ONI was used against most of the

endpoints, MBR-ONI was used on only a handful of endpoints. These endpoints were

critical assets such as an AD server and file servers. We suspect that MBR-ONI was

used as a wiper to conceal the operation’s true motive.

Penetration vector: Spear-phishing drops Ammyy Admin RAT

The penetration vector used in the observed attacks consisted of spear-phishing emails

that carried password-protected zip files containing weaponized Office documents.

http://www.ammyy.com/en/admin_features.html
https://www.cybereason.com/


Once the victims extracted the zip file and opened the document, they were lured into

enabling a macro. That launched a VBScript that downloaded and executed the Ammyy

Admin RAT.

 

 

Once installed, Ammyy Admin runs as a service (“Time service”) with SYSTEM

privileges:

https://www.cybereason.com/


 

The hash of the Ammyy Admin binary is unknown to VirusTotal and other threat intel

engines (6abfb50b0657e87d8aec594ccc95f2e1b13f355e):

The earliest indication of the Ammyy Admin RAT on the compromised environment

dates back to December 2016. The RAT was used in some instances until September

2017. This indicates that the attack were carried over a period at least nine months:

https://www.cybereason.com/


 

Ammyy Admin is a legitimate remote administration tool that attackers have hijacked

and used for malicious activity, including attacks on financial institutions by a threat

actor believed to be related to the Carbanak group. Additionally, Ammyy Admin was

involved in a supply-chain attack. In that incident, threat actors compromised Ammyy

Admin’s website and replaced the installer with a trojanized version of the RAT.

Lateral movement and DC takeover

Once the attackers gained foothold in the victim’s environment, their next step was to

compromise critical assets including file servers, application servers and the DC. The

attackers managed to move laterally within the internal network through shared network

drives and other techniques.  

We suspect that the threat actor used the NSA-leaked exploit EternalBlue, in

conjunction with other tools to spread throughout the network. Due to the data

corruption and robust log wiping, it cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty,

however, it was found that the MS17-010 security update (released in March 2017) was

not installed on the compromised machines at the time that attacks took place (July-

September 2017). As shown in the example below, SMBv1 was still enabled across the

compromised environments:

https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks

https://securelist.com/lurk-a-danger-where-you-least-expect-it/75384/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx
https://www.cybereason.com/


ONI shares a lot of its code with GlobeImposter ransomware variants. While

GlobeImposter variants are not known to spread via Eternal Blue, it has been reported

that GlobeImposter was also used in targeted attacks that involved EternalBlue and

other NSA-leaked exploits in the past. 

Eventually, the attackers gained domain admin and successfully compromised the DC

and Active Directory servers, which enabled them to obtain full control over the

network.

Covering tracks: Logs deletion and ONI distribution via Group Policy Scripts

Using GPO, the attackers deployed “wiping” scripts that resided on the compromised

DC. The purpose of those scripts was to delete event and security logs from the

compromised machines and distribute the ONI ransomware as the last step of the

operation. 

Autorun persistence of the group policy scripts used in the attack:

ONI ransomware observations

ONI received its name based on the file extension that it appends to the files it encrypts.

The name ONI can mean “devil” in Japanese (鬼), and it also appears in the email

address found in its ransom note. “Oninoy0ru” translates into “Night of the Devil” in

Japanese (鬼の夜). Cybereason observed other versions of ONI’s ransom note that

contained other email addresses whose username also included the string “ONI”.

ONI seems to share code with GlobeImposter ransomware variants. Some routines are

identical, as shown below:

Example of one of the identified ONI ransomware samples

SHA-1 hash: b7d33751d118fab6aedabfdf6a4ddf627e6cab02

Example of code similarity

GlobeImposter ransomware variant

SHA-1 hash: 4a850136af93b9918fb4290a2bf665c4f28201d1

Example of code similarity

Aside from encrypting files on the infected machines, ONI can encrypt files on

removable media and network drives, as seen below:

https://www.cybereason.com/


Interestingly, the resources section found in ONI’s PE file shows Russian language

traces.

While this type of evidence could have been left there on purpose by the attackers as

decoy, it can also suggest that the attacks were carried out by Russian speakers or, at

the very least, that the ransomware was written by Russian speakers.

MBR-ONI: Under the hood

While most of the infected machines were infected with ONI, MBR-ONI has been

observed only on a handful of machines. These machines consisted of the Active

Directory server as well as other carefully selected critical assets. The machines

infected by MBR-ONI all exhibited the same ransom note, which contained the same

message and same ID for all the infected machines, as opposed to ONI, which

generates a unique ID per machine:

https://www.cybereason.com/


When examining the MBR of the infected machine, it is clear that the MBR-ONI

modified the original MBR, as the first instructions consist of the familiar NOP-NOP-

JMP, also used by DiskCryptor, which can be found on GitHub:

Further analysis of MBR-ONI confirms that the attackers used a modified version of a

legitimate open-source tool called DiskCryptor. The tool, according to DiskCryptor’s

website, “is an open encryption solution that offers encryption of all disk partitions,

including the system partition.”

For example, when comparing the strings found in the MBR-ONI bootkit ransomware

with the ones of the publicly-available DiskCryptor, the resemblance is quite evident, as

this screenshot shows:

https://diskcryptor.net/wiki/Main_Page
https://github.com/smartinm/diskcryptor/blob/a47ad40d2752894bdf9c7954c3e4fbcef62b68b0/boot/vc2008_src/asm/mbr_boot.asm#L12
https://www.cybereason.com/


Error code strings found on the GitHub page of DiskCryptor:  

https://github.com/legiar/diskcryptor/blob/master/boot/boot_load.c

Unlike the notorious wiper NotPetya, MBR-ONI’s code does allow for the recovery of

the encrypted disk, given that the attackers supply the right decryption key. From a

technical perspective, we classify this specimen as ransomware rather than a wiper.

That being said, we suspect that the attackers never intended to provide recovery for

the encrypted machines. Instead, the program was meant to be used as a wiper to

cover the attackers’ footprints and conceal the attack’s motive.

The legitimate encryption utility, DiskCryptor, was recently abused by the threat actors

behind Bad Rabbit. Another example of a well-known ransomware that was also used

in targeted attacks is the Mamba / HDDCryptor ransomware, which also uses

DiskCryptor’s open-source code.  

This example demonstrates the fine line between a legitimate disk encryption tool and

malware. How the tool is implemented changes its original purpose and gives the tool a

different context, such as a bootkit ransomware or even a destructive wiper.

Ransomware or wiper?

Classifying ONI and MBR-ONI merely as ransomware leaves some open questions

regarding the observed attacks. There’s enough evidence to suggest that ONI and

https://github.com/legiar/diskcryptor/blob/master/boot/boot_load.c
https://thehackernews.com/2017/10/bad-rabbit-ransomware-attack.html
https://securelist.com/ransomware-in-targeted-attacks/77877/
https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/disk-locking-hddcryptor-mamba-ransomware-makes-a-comeback
https://www.cybereason.com/


MBR-ONI worked more like wiper attempting to cover up an ongoing hacking operation

by destroying data instead of a ransomware attack that encrypted files.  

There are a couple of points worth raising in the context of these attacks:  

1. Why use two types of ransomware in the same operation?

2. Why did the attackers use MBR-ONI only on a few machines, while ONI was used on

the majority of the infected machines?

3. Why does ONI use unique IDs on each machine while MBR-ONI uses the same ID

across all the machines it infects? This inconsistency between the two ransomware

programs is very peculiar. It is very unlikely that an attacker would not be interested in

distinguishing between infected machines. That also supports our suspicion that there

was never an intention to recover the encrypted disk partitions. 

4. In addition to the ransomware, the attackers used a batch file whose purpose was to

thoroughly clear more than 460 Windows’ event logs. This robust log-wiping action

shows that the attackers wanted to destroy evidence that could potentially lead to the

discovery of their methods as well as the motive behind the attack.

5. Why spend three to nine months in the environment without a sure plan to make

money? From a cost-effectiveness perspective, there is no guarantee the attacker will

be rewarded with a ransom payment at the end of this long operation, despite

sustaining an active operation and risking detection. 

Conclusion
In this blog, we showed that ONI and the newly discovered MBR-ONI stem from the

same threat actor, shed light on the threat actor’s modus operandi and gave context

that can better explain these supposed ransomware attacks. While both ONI and MBR-

ONI clearly exhibit all the characteristics of ransomware, we provided arguments that

support our suspicion that the attackers might have intended to use them as wipers

rather than ransomware. We do not dismiss the possibility that financial gain was the

motive behind these attacks. However, given the nature of the attacks and the profile of

the targeted companies, other motives should not be dismissed lightly.  

While the ONI attacks presented in this blog are specific to Japan, we believe they also

point to a concerning global trend. Using ransomware in targeted hacking operations is

still quite uncommon compared to the popularity of ransomware in the overall cyber

https://www.cybereason.com/


threat landscape. In recent years, though, there have been increased reports about

ransomware and wipers used in targeted attacks carried out by cybercriminals and

nation-states. Examples of these ransomware and/or wipers include: PetWrap, Mamba,

SamSam, NotPetya, Shamoon and Bad Rabbit.  

We also discussed how threat actors abuse legitimate tools like DiskCryptor and

Ammyy Admin and use them for malicious purposes. This further emphasizes the fine

line between publicly available tools and malware. In many cases, this distinction can

only be determined by figuring out the operator’s intent. For instance, MBR-ONI

borrows a large portion of its code from DiskCryptor. With some code modification, a

legitimate disk encryption utility can be turned into ransomware or even a destructive

wiper.
