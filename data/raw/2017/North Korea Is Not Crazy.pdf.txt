North Korea Is Not
Crazy
By Insikt Group on June 15, 2017

Intent is critical to comprehending North
Korean cyber activity.

Understanding North Korean national objectives, state
organizations, and military strategy are key to, and often
missing from, discussions about attributing North Korean



cyber activity. Frequently, senior political leaders, cyber
security professionals, and diplomats describe North
Korean leaders or their respective actions as “crazy,”
“erratic,” or “not rational.” This is not the case. When
examined through the lens of North Korean military
strategy, national goals, and security perceptions, cyber
activities correspond to their larger approach.

Recorded Future research reveals that North Korean
cyber actors are not crazy or irrational: they just have a
wider operational scope than most other intelligence
services.

This scope comprises a broad range of criminal and
terrorist activity, including illegal drug manufacturing and
selling, counterfeit currency production, bombings,
assassination attempts, and more. The National Security
Agency (NSA) has attributed the April WannaCry
ransomware attacks to North Korea’s intelligence service,
the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). We assess
that use of ransomware to raise funds for the state
would fall under both North Korea’s asymmetric military
strategy and ”self-�nancing” policy, and be within the
broad operational remit of their intelligence services.

Background
The Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK or North Korea) is a
hereditary, Asian monarchy with state,
party, and military organizations
dedicated to preserving the leadership
of the Kim family. North Korea is organized around its
communist party, the Korean Worker’s Party (KWP), and
the military, the Korean People’s Army (KPA).

The Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), also known
as “Unit 586,” was formed in 2009 after a large
restructure of several state, military, and party
intelligence elements. Subordinate to the KPA, it has
since emerged as not just the dominant North Korean
foreign intelligence service, but also the center for
clandestine operations. The RGB and its predecessor
organizations are believed responsible for a series of
bombings, assassination attempts, hijackings, and
kidnappings commencing in the late 1950s, as well as a
litany of criminal activities, including drug smuggling and
manufacturing, counterfeiting, destructive cyber attacks,
and more.

As North Korea’s lead for clandestine operations, the RGB
is also likely the primary cyber operations organization as
well. As described by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in 2015 report:

The RGB is a hub of North Korean intelligence,
commando, and sabotage operations. The RGB

history of its leadership and component parts paints

a picture of a one-stop shop for illegal and
clandestine activity conducted outside the DPRK. The
RGB and, prior to 2009 its component parts, have
been involved in everything from maritime-inserted
commando raids to abductions and spying. For the
RGB to be in control of cyber assets indicates that
the DPRK intends to use these assets for provocative
purposes.

The RGB probably consists of seven bureaus; six original
bureaus and a new seventh (Bureau 121) that was likely
added sometime after 2013.

RGB organizational chart, compiled with information from The Korea
Herald, 38 North, and CSIS.

Bureau 121 is probably North Korea’s primary cyber
operations unit, but there are other units within the KPA
and KWP that may also conduct cyber operations.

Attribution of speci�c cyber activity to the North Korean
state or intelligence organizations is di�cult, and up until
recently, circumstantial. On June 12, US-CERT released a
joint technical alert that summarized analysis conducted
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and
FBI on the “tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of
the North Korean government to target the media,
aerospace, �nancial, and critical infrastructure sectors in
the United States and globally.”

This alert marked the �rst time the U.S. government
linked threat actor groups and malware long-suspected

to be utilized by North Korean state-sponsored actors
with the with North Korean government itself. DHS and
FBI explicitly identi�ed two threat actor groups, Lazarus
Group and Guardians of Peace, and three tools,
Destover, Wild Positron/Duuzer, and Hangman, as used
by the North Korean government. While the FBI and DHS
identi�ed many indicators of compromise, Yara rules,
and network signatures, the report did not provide any
evidence supporting the attribution to the North Korean
government or details on which organization or unit
might be responsible.

Lazarus Group, now known to be North Korean state-
sponsored actors, have been conducting operations since
at least 2009, with a DDoS attack on U.S. and South
Korean websites using the MYDOOM worm. Until late
2015, Lazarus Group cyber activities primarily focused on
South Korean and U.S. government and �nancial
organizations, including destructive attacks on South
Korean banking and media sectors in 2013 and highly
publicized attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014.

Timeline of Lazarus Group cyber operations since 2009.

In early 2016, a new pattern of activity began to emerge
in an unusual operation against the Bangladesh Central
Bank. Actors obtained the legitimate Bangladesh Central
Bank credentials for the SWIFT interbank messaging

system and used them to attempt to transfer $951
million of the bank’s funds to accounts around the world.
A few simple errors by the actors (and some pure luck)
allowed central bankers to prevent the transfer of or
recover most of the funds, but the attackers ended up
getting away with nearly $81 million.

The National Security Agency (NSA) has attributed this
attack on the Bangladesh Central Bank to the North
Korean state, however, the investigation within the U.S.
government is still ongoing. Threat analysts from
numerous companies have attributed this attack and
subsequent attacks on banks around the world through
early 2017 to the Lazarus Group (which DHS, FBI, and
NSA have all linked to the North Korean government over
the past three days).

According to a Washington Post report published on June
14, the NSA has compiled an intelligence assessment on
the WannaCry campaign and has attributed the creation
of the WannaCry worm to “cyber actors sponsored by”
the RGB. This assessment, which was apparently issued
internally last week, cited “moderate con�dence” in the
attribution and ascribed the April campaign as an
“attempt to raise revenue for the regime.”

The attacks on the Bangladesh Central Bank, additional
banks around the world, and the WannaCry ransomware
campaign represent a new phase in North Korean cyber
operations, one that mirrors the phases of violence and
criminality North Korea has passed through over the past
50 years. We will examine these phases later in this post.

The broad operational range of known and suspected
North Korean cyber operations has for years raised
questions about the rationality of North Korean
leadership, possible motivations and bene�ts for the
country from this type of cyber activity, and why North

Korea would deny responsibility for these attacks.
Recorded Future research addresses these questions by
examining the whole picture and pairing geopolitical and
strategic intelligence with threat intelligence.

Analysis
Digging into some of these past North Korean activities is
important to add context to the cyber operations we
have tracked since 2009. North Korea’s engagement in a
wide range of criminal and terrorist activities is part of its
broad national strategy, which employs asymmetric
operations and surprise attacks to overcome North
Korea’s conventional national power de�cit.

According to an interview with a former U.S. State
Department o�cial, and North Korea expert, in Vanity
Fair, “crime, in other words, has become an integral part
of North Korea’s economy. ‘It not only pays, it plays to
their strategy of undermining Western interests. ’”

It is critical to place North Korea’s criminal and cyber
activity in the context of its larger military and national
security strategies which support two primary objectives:

1. Perpetuation of the Kim regime,
2. Uni�cation of the Korean peninsula under North

Korean leadership.

A 2016 University of Washington study succinctly
summarizes North Korea’s asymmetric military strategy:

Since the end of the Korean War, North Korea has
developed an asymmetric military strategy, weapons,
and strength because its conventional military power
is far weaker than that of the U.S. and South Korea.
Thus, North Korea has developed three military

strategic pillars: surprise attack; quick decisive war;
mixed tactics. First, its surprise attack strategy refers
to attacking the enemy at an unexpected time and
place. Second, its quick decisive war strategy is to
defeat the South Korean military before the U.S.
military or international community could intervene.
Lastly, its mixed tactics strategy is to use multiple
tactics at the same time to achieve its strategic goal.

Despite their near-constant tirade of bellicose rhetoric
and professions of strength, North Korea fundamentally
views the world from a position of weakness, and has
developed a national strategy that utilizes its comparative
strengths — complete control over a population of 25
million people and un�inching, amoral devotion to the
Kim hereditary dynasty.

In this context, criminality, terrorism, and destructive
cyber attacks all �t within the North Korean asymmetric
military strategy which emphasizes surprise attacks and
mixed tactics. The criminality and cyber attacks also have
the added bonus of enabling North Korea to undermine
the very international economic and political systems
that constrain and punish it.

Evidence is mounting that sanctions, international
pressure, and possibly increased enforcement by China
are beginning to take their toll on the North Korean
economy and in particular, North Korea intelligence
agent’s ability to procure goods for regime leadership. A
May 2017 report from the Korea Development Institute
concluded that North Korea’s black market had helped
the nation endure the impacts of the international
sanctions last year.

Detailed below are numerous non-cyber operations that
have been conducted by the predecessor organizations

of the RGB. The violence, destruction, and criminal
breadth of these operations reveal the broad operational
scope of these intelligence services and the context in
which they are conducted.

This data further reveals a history of denials by North
Korea of responsibility for operations dating back to the
1960s, putting into context the current leadership’s
denials of cyber operations.

Note
The activities detailed below are intended to be
illustrative, not an exhaustive list, of the broad
operational remit for North Korean operations.

“Blue House Raid”
One of the �rst major attacks on South Korea since the
armistice was declared after the Korean War in 1953
occurred in 1968. The so-called “Blue House Raid” was an
assassination attempt on then-President Park Chung Hee
by 31 North Korean special operations soldiers on the
night of January 20, 1968. The 31 North Korean soldiers
crossed the DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ) on foot and
managed to get within a half mile of the President’s
residence (the so-called “Blue House”) before being
exposed. Upon discovery the North Korean soldiers
engaged in a series of �re�ghts with South Korean forces;
68 South Koreans and three U.S. soldiers were killed.
Most of the North Korean soldiers were killed in the eight
days after the raid; two made it back across the DMZ and
one was captured.

The captured North Korean soldier claimed during a
press conference that they had come to “cut Park Chung
Hee’s throat.” That account was disputed during a secret
meeting in 1972 between a South Korean intelligence
o�cial and the then-Premier Kim Il-sung. Kim claimed his
government had nothing to do with the raid and “did not
even know about it at the time.”

1983 Rangoon Bombing
On October 9, 1983, three North Korean soldiers
attempted to assassinate then-South Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan while on a trip to Myanmar. A bomb at a
mausoleum the President was scheduled to visit
detonated early, killing 21 people, including the Korean
Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.

During the trial for the bombers, testimony revealed that
the North Korean agents used a North Korean trading
vessel to travel to Myanmar and the home of a North
Korean diplomat to prepare the bombs. In a classi�ed
report (report was declassi�ed in 2000) ten days after the
bombing, CIA analysts laid out a strong case that North
Korea was responsible for the attack despite o�cial

denials of involvement from the o�cial North Korean

news agency. North Korean state media even accused
President Chun of using the attack to increase tensions
on the peninsula.

Korean Air Flight 858
Bombing
On November 29, 1987, two North Korean intelligence
agents boarded and placed a bomb on a Korean Air �ight
from Baghdad, Iraq to Seoul. During a layover in Abu
Dhabi, the two agents de-planed but left the bomb
(disguised as a radio) onboard. The bomb detonated and
the plane crashed in the jungle on the Thai-Burma border
and killed all 115 people on board.

One of the North Korean intelligence agents, who was
captured alive, later revealed that the bombing was
meant to “discourage foreign participation in the 1988
Olympic Games in Seoul and create unrest” in South
Korea. The agent also confessed that the order to bomb
the plane had come directly from then North Korean
leader Kim Il-Sung or his son, later leader Kim Jong-il.

By the mid-1990s, North Korea had generally shifted
from acts of terrorism to criminality. While North Korea
had held a policy of “self-�nancing, ” in which embassies
and diplomatic outposts were forced to earn money for
their own operations typically via engaging in illicit
activity such as smuggling, since the late 1970s, it was
during the 1990s that this criminality became a business
of the entire state and not just the diplomatic
establishment. A number of factors a�ected this shift,
including the end of the Cold War and the withdrawal of
crucial aid from benefactors (like the Soviet Union and
China), a crippling famine, a leadership transition, and
years of international condemnation and punitive
actions.

A 2015 report from the Committee for Human Rights in
North Korea characterizes North Korea’s involvement in
“illicit economic activities” into three separate phases.
First, from the origins of North Korea state involvement
in the 1970s through mid-1990s, from the mid-90s
through the mid-2000s, and approximately 2005 to
today. The RGB, its predecessor organizations, and other
military and intelligence services support these illicit
activities.

Illegal Drug Manufacturing
and Smuggling
North Korea has had a state-sponsored drug smuggling
(and later manufacturing as well) program since the mid-
1970s. This vast enterprise has been supported by the
military, intelligence services, and diplomats and has
often included working with criminal organizations such
as the Taiwanese gang United Bamboo, Philippine
criminal syndicates, and Japanese organized crime.

Academic research indicates that North Korea has
developed extensive covert smuggling networks and
capabilities primarily to provide a means of hard
currency for the Kim regime.

The North Korean state actively cultivates opium poppy
and produces as much as 50 metric tons of raw opium
per year. To put that in context, the United Nations
estimates that Afghanistan produced 6,400 tons of raw
opium in 2014, which makes North Korea a minor
producer in comparison. According to a Congressional
Research Service report, government processing labs
have the capacity to process twice that amount into
opium or heroin each year. Experts estimate that North
Korea brings in as much as $550 million to $1 billion
annually from illicit economic activities.

Counterfeiting
One of the more widely reported North Korean criminal
enterprises has been the production of counterfeit
American $100 (and $50) bills, or so-called “supernotes.”
In a 2006 Congressional testimony, the U.S. Secret
Service made a de�nitive link between the production of
the “supernote” and the North Korean state.

According to interviews in a 2006 New York Times
Magazine article, North Korean state support for
counterfeiting U.S. currency dates back to a directive
issued by Kim Jong-il in the mid-1970s. Original
counterfeiting involved bleaching $1 bills and reprinting
them as $100 notes and evolved over time as North
Korea’s international isolation grew and its economy
collapsed.

“Supernote” and a real $100 bill. (Source)

Distribution and production of the supernotes followed a
similar pattern to North Korean-produced narcotics,
utilizing global criminal syndicates, state and intelligence
o�cials, and legitimate businesses. North Korea has
repeatedly denied involvement in counterfeiting or any
illegal operations.

A History of Denial
As outlined above, North Korea has a history of denying
responsibility for their violent, illicit, and destructive
operations. This includes denying involvement in the Blue
House Raid, the Rangoon Bombing, all criminal and illicit
activity including counterfeiting U.S. dollars, the Sony
Pictures Entertainment attack, and the Bangladesh
Central Bank robbery. Some scholars argue that acts
such as counterfeiting a nation’s currency constitutes a
casus belli, an action or event that justi�es war, and
others argue that “international legal norms and
constructs do not adequately address what constitutes
casus belli in the cyber domain.”

Both of these arguments, as well as an understanding of
North Korea’s asymmetric military strategy, underscore
why North Korea would not want to claim responsibility
for many of these destructive and violent acts.
Acknowledging state responsibility could provide the
United States or South Korea with a valid casus belli,
resulting in a war that North Korea would most certainly
lose. Even if the evidence is strong, o�cial government
denials create uncertainty and give North Korea space to
continue operations.

Impact
What has been missing from the discussion about
whether North Korea is responsible for the WannaCry
campaign and the bank heists has been the why — the
geopolitical and strategic intelligence that give CSOs,
security professionals, and threat analysts context for the
activity they are seeing.

As of last week the NSA and several companies, including
Symantec and Kaspersky, have linked the recent
WannaCry ransomware campaign to North Korea;
Recorded Future assesses that this type of cyber activity
would fall within both North Korea’s “self-�nancing”
policy and asymmetric military strategy.

In this context, as a nation that is under immense
international �nancial and political pressure and one that
employs these types of policies and strategies, Recorded
Future believes that North Korean cyber operations (with
the goal of acquiring hard currency) will continue for at
least the short to medium term (one to three years).
Additionally, destructive cyber operations against the
South Korean government and commercial entities will
persist over this same term and likely expand to Japanese

or Western organizations if U.S. and North Korea
tensions remain high.

The cyber threat environment and military strategy
framed above indicate that companies in several major
economic sectors should increase monitoring of North
Korean cyber activity. Financial services �rms must
remain constantly vigilant to exploitation of their SWIFT
connections and credentials, possible destructive
malware attacks and DDoS, and threats to customer
accounts and data. Companies in the government
contracting and defense sectors, especially companies
that support the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD) system deployment as well as U.S. or South
Korean operations on peninsula, should be aware of the
heightened threat environment to their networks and
operations on the Korean peninsula.

Energy and media companies, particularly those located
in or that support these sectors in South Korea, should
be alert to a wide range of cyber activity from North
Korea, including DDoS, destructive malware, and
ransomware attacks. Broadly, organizations in all sectors
should continue to be aware of the adaptability of
ransomware and modify their cyber security strategies as
the threat evolves.

This is part one of a two-part series on North Korea. In
part two, we will examine patterns of behavior and
internet activity from North Korea, including the
widespread use of virtual private servers (VPS) and virtual
private networks (VPN) to obfuscate browsing, internet
transactions, and other, possibly malicious, activity.

While there is no perfect analog to the state-sponsored criminality
that North Korea engages in, Iran is probably the closest in terms of
intelligence services’ operational scope. For more on Iranian security

Not all operations to generate funds under this “self-�nancing”
policy are illegal in their host countries.
