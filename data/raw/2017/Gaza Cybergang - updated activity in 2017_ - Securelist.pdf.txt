1. Summary information
The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated

cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the

MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks

have never slowed down and its typical targets include government

entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and

diplomats.

One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery

inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems

and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.

Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE

2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the

download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their

detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April

2017, are also being investigated.

Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do

not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking different

kinds of MENA intelligence.

Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:

Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in

government entities in MENA

New targets identified include oil and gas in MENA

New tools and techniques include

Abuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability

Usage of macros inside Microsoft Access files, enabling lower

detection rates

Possible Android mobile malware being used by attackers

2. Technical details
Previously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using

simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a variety

of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including

Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…

As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE

2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a

Microsoft office document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike

payload in this case). Another finding is a possible Android Trojan that the

attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017.

In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or

download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed

downloaders or Microsoft office documents with embedded macros

being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a

URL or IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully

executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them

with the ability to collect files, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’

devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the

downloader would attempt to retrieve other malware files to the victim’s

device, in the hope that one of those files would work.

The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix

I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware files and related

droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.

4. New findings
Gaza Cybergang attackers have been continuously evolving their skills on

different levels, using new methods and techniques to deliver malware, in



addition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and

humanitarian incidents.

In mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas

organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data,

apparently for more than a year. The malware files that were found had

been reported previously: https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-

wheres-your-ir-team/72283/

While traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers

have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or

Cobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain

remote access spying and data exfiltration abilities. This is now achieved

more efficiently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables

direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft office document on non-

patched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database

files has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of detection, as

it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware.

These developments have helped the attackers continue their operations,

targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even

bypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods.

4.1. The extended use of humanitarian
and political causes in social
engineering attacks

Attackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in

government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists,

politicians, and diplomats.

The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date

social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that

directly reflect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were

each used multiple times:

Palestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees

Palestinian prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails

The political crisis in Qatar

Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do

not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any type

of intelligence.

Microsoft Access files with macro is another new development by the

attacker group. MS Access database-embedded macros are proving to

have very low detection rates.

The attacks are a typical exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, starting with an

email that distributes a malicious RTF document. The vulnerability is in the

code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft

Office Word to run remote files, downloaded in this case from

138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then

connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers.

Additional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with

Cobaltstrike, can be found here:

http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4193.html

4.4. Possible Android mobile malware

Traces of APK files have been seen on one of the attackers’ command

centers, starting from 23-04-2017.

The file name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is

an Android application file hiding as a popular game. We believe the

android Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android

Trojan around the Gaza strip: https://securelist.com/breaking-the-

The Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and

advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of attacks,

infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques.

Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an effort to minimize their

exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these

types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of quality and

quantity.

In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab

researchers recommend implementing the following measures:

Educate staff to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a

phishing link from legitimate emails and links

Use proven corporate grade security solution in combination with

anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by

analyzing network anomalies

Provide security staff with access to the latest threat intelligence data,

which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks prevention

and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules

Make sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well

established and executed.
