RSA Incident Response White Paper: Inside the Response of a Unique CARBANAK
Intrusion  
 
RSA Incident Response and Discovery Practice (RSA IR) analysts spend a significant�
amount of time engaged in the research, hunting, and effective response of advanced�
and persistent actors.  A customer engagement early-to-mid-2017 is an excellent
example of a unique case in which RSA IR successfully responded to an intrusion
perpetrated by the threat actor group CARBANAK , also known as FIN7.  The
CARBANAK actions illustrated in this post and associated paper were observed with
other RSA clients as recently as November 2017, with the methods and intelligence
supplied by these publications having been used successfully to detect and track
attacker activities.
 
Several intrusions associated with the CARBANAK actors have been reported within the last
year, describing compromises of organizations within banking , financial� , hospitality ,
and restaurant  verticals.  However, they all describe a relatively equivalent progression,
with only slight deviation in specific attacker actions.  The intelligence surrounding�
recent CARBANAK incidents indicate that phishing attacks  have been the groupʼs
primary method of initial compromise.  After gaining access to a user system, the attackers
move laterally throughout the environment, conduct internal reconnaissance, establish
staging points and internal network paths, harvest credentials, and move towards their
intended target. However, this intrusion began with a significantly higher level of privilege�

due to the exploitation of the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2017-5638  allowing the
attackers to quickly gain administrative access within the clientʼs Linux environment.  This
intrusion presented substantial challenges due to:

The initial intrusion vector
Unique attacker toolset
The attacker dwell time
The large, heterogeneous environment
The speed with which the attackers gained administrative access
The forensic mindfulness of the CARBANAK attackers

The attackersʼ toolset was a mix of custom tools, freely available code, and open source
software utilities.  RSA IR researched all 32 of the malicious files in the� CARBANAK toolset
using various publicly available and open-source resources.  Six of the tools used in this
intrusion were found to have been uploaded to a publicly available anti-virus aggregation
site. Of these six, five have little-to-no detection or indication of malice from antivirus�
vendors.  This observation explains why the clientʼs signature-based host protection
mechanisms were unable to identify or prevent the use of these tools.  

Figure 1: Findings from Public and Open Source Research of Toolset Reference

While the attackers used more than 30 unique samples of malware and tools, they also
demonstrated a normalization across Windows and Linux with respect to their toolset.  The
toolsets they deployed can be broken down into five basic functionalities:�

Ingress/Egress/Remote Access

Lateral Movement
Log Cleanup
Credential Harvesting
Internal Reconnaissance

The ingress, lateral movement, and internal reconnaissance mechanisms used by the
attackers during this investigation were not that sophisticated in and of themselves. 
However, when viewed in aggregate, and from an operational view, RSA observed the actors
normalized their choice in toolset across the Linux and Windows environments.  The
attackers in this engagement primarily used modified versions of legitimate administrative�
tools, commonly used penetration testing utilities, and common network file acquisition�
tools.  Though specialty malware was observed during this intrusion, the attackers used
basic XOR encoding just above Layer 4 to facilitate communication, communicated via SSH
tunnel directly over TCP/443, or just transmitted and received data in clear text across the
network.  Of the observed actions during this intrusion, none of the attacker tools,
techniques, or procedures were particularly advanced.  However, they were still able to
bypass a significant security stack, obtain initial access and lateral access effectively, deploy��
malware and toolsets with impunity, and traverse over 150 systems in the span of six
weeks.  While, at first glance, this attack was not sophisticated in its toolset, it was�
sophisticated in its operationalization and agility of attackersʼ actions.  The correlations
between the Linux environment tools and the Windows environment tools are shown below:

RSA IR released a white paper  containing an in-depth review of this engagement,
including observed attacker operational patterns, TTPs, and the techniques used during this
engagement to successfully track and respond to the threat.  The observations illustrated in
this paper identify that not only do CARBANAK actors have the capability to successfully
compromise various operating system environments, they have standardized and
operationalized this capability.  This attribute indicates strategic operational thought and
effort being invested in this groupʼs compromises, suggesting that the� CARBANAK actors
are working towards becoming a more organized, structured, resourceful, and mature
threat group.

During an intrusion, time is the single most critical resource to an organizationʼs security
team and is the most significant indicator of determining if the security team will be�
successful in containing, eradicating, and remediating the extant threat.  There are two
specific sets of time related to an intrusion that may determine the difference between��
success and failure: the time that the attackers are in the environment prior to detection
(dwell time), and the time it takes security teams to identify, investigate, understand, and
contain the attackerʼs actions (response time).  In this specific incident, the attackerʼs dwell�
time at intrusion declaration was 35 days, which is a significant amount of time given the�
level of access immediately available upon compromise.  However, by utilizing
the methodology and visibility described in this paper, RSA IR was able to complete
containment, eradication, and remediation in only nine days.  We also discuss

https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2016/12/01/new-hunting-guide-investigation-model


the methodology used by RSA IR to successfully detect, investigate, understand, and
contain the attackers before the actors could achieve their intended goal.

The CARBANAK actors not only showed the capability to successfully compromise both
Linux and Windows systems, they chose a toolset that was either directly cross-platform or
extremely similar in both function and command line usage.  This indicates a level of
tactical organization and operationalization not previously observed by this actor group. 
Additionally, they were significantly cognizant and aware of actions taken by the security�
team, switching to new methods of ingress after initial compromise, detected remediation
actions, and environmental migration.  They were methodical in their choice of staging
systems, basing the system utilized on:

a critical function of lateral access
or responder detection and investigation

They chose key systems based on their needs rather than systems the organization would
consider ʻkeyʼ assets. They ensured the toolsets they would interact with most often
contained very similar functions and commands across environments in order to limit
mistakes made at the keyboard.  They included a method, whether manually or
automatically, to remove any record of their activities.  They operated with purpose,
patience, planning, and most significantly, persistence.�

This intrusion was successfully discovered, investigated, contained, eradicated, and
remediated only due to the following reasons:

1. The organization invested in the necessary visibility at a host and network level to
allow analysts to rapidly and effectively hunt for and investigate these types of�
threats.

2. The organization had invested and empowered their personnel to creatively and
proactively hunt for, understand, investigate, and learn from threats within their
environment.

3. The organization had maintained a relationship with a proven and trusted advisory
practice and had worked to recreate and implement a solid and proven Threat
Hunting and Incident Response methodology within their own organization.

4. The organization had a solid top-down understanding of what role Threat Hunting
and Incident Response held during daily operations and security incidents, and
provided the necessary support and enablement to subordinate units and analysts.

While a first look at the tools used in this engagement may appear simplistic, upon review�
of the entire intrusion, it becomes quickly apparent that each of them was purpose-chosen
with an overall operationalized capability in mind.  CARBANAK has shown themselves to be
a coordinated and extremely persistent group of actors that are consistently moving
towards more agile methods of intrusion and standardization of processes across

heterogeneous environments.  They have proven their capability to use that persistence and
agility to defeat or bypass organizational security controls.  Even with the least advanced of
their capabilities, they can be a difficult adversary to track within an environment due to��
their speed, efficiency, adaptability, and care in leaving little trace of any activity.  However,��
this difficulty compounds exponentially for organizations without the necessary visibility,��
practices, methodologies, or trusted partner relationships necessary to effectively detect�
and respond to these types of threats.  This white paper shows that with the necessary
visibility, planning, methodology, and analyst enablement, organizations can be successful
against these types of threats.
