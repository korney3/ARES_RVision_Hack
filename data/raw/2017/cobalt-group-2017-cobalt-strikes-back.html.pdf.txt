Cobalt strikes back: an evolving multinational threat to finance�

Bank robbery is perhaps the quintessential crime. The promise of immense, instant riches has lured
many a criminal to target banks. And while the methods, tools, and scale of robbery have all changed,
two things have stayed the same: the enticement of a hefty payday and the fact that no system is
perfectly secure.

In the modern digital economy, criminals are becoming ever more creative in ways to make off with
millions without having to leave home. Despite enormous efforts, security is always a work in progress
because of technical vulnerabilities and the human factor. Only a small fraction of banks today are able
to withstand targeted attacks of the kind perpetrated by Cobalt, a cybercriminal group first described in�
2016 that is currently active worldwide. Now the group has set its sights on more than just banks.

Researchers at Positive Technologies and other companies have described the group's methods
previously. In this report, we will describe the new techniques used by Cobalt in 2017, the changing
target profile, and recommendations on how to avoid becoming their latest victim.�

The Cobalt group has been quick to react to banks' protective measures. When spam filters on mail�
servers began to block most of the group's phishing emails, which contained forged sender
information, the attackers changed techniques. Now they actively use Supply Chain Attacks to
leverage the infrastructure and accounts of actual employees at one company, in order to forge
convincing emails targeting a different partner organization. This tactic has already been used by other
attackers, such as when the infrastructure of M.E.Doc was used to spread the NotPetya virus, which
blocked workstations at a large number of major companies.

Cobalt has attacked banks, financial exchanges, insurance companies, investment funds, and other�
financial organizations. The group is not afraid to use the names of regulatory authorities or security�
topics to trick recipients into opening phishing messages from illegitimate domains.

Here is some of the latest information about techniques used by the Cobalt group:
Active attacks on bank partners in order to use partner infrastructure for sending phishing
messages to banks. 
Phishing messages disguised as mailings from financial regulators.�
Various types of malicious attachments: document with an exploit (.doc, .xls, .rtf), archive
with an executable dropper file (.scr, .exe), and archive with LNK file (.lnk).��
Among the first groups to get access to the latest version of the Microsoft Word Intruder 8�
exploit builder, which made it possible to create documents exploiting vulnerability CVE-
2017-0199.
Poorly protected public sites are used to upload files and then download them to victim�
computers.
Phishing messages are sent both to corporate addresses and personal addresses of
employees.

The Cobalt group's traditional "stomping grounds" are the Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and
Southeast Asia. In 2017, attacks grew to include North America, Western Europe, and even South
America (Argentina). 

Of the companies targeted by Cobalt in phishing mailings, around 75 percent are in the financial�
sector. Most of these financial companies are banks (90%), but others include financial exchanges,��
investment funds, and lenders. This widening range of targets suggests that attacks on diverse
companies with major financial flows are underway. This concurs with the forecast made by the��
FinCERT of the Russian Central Bank, which predicted increased interest by cybercriminals in financial�
exchanges in 2017.

By attacking a financial exchange, the Cobalt group can "pump" or "dump" stocks, incentivizing�
purchase or sale of shares in certain companies in a way that causes rapid fluctuations in share price.�
Stock manipulation can affect not just the welfare of a single company, but the economy of entire
countries. These methods were employed by the Corkow group in their 2016 attack on Russia's
Energobank, which caused a 15-percent change in the exchange rate of the ruble and caused bank
losses of RUB 244 million (over USD 4 million).

The remaining 25 percent of targeted companies represent diverse industries:
Government
Telecom/Internet
Service Providers
Manufacturing
Entertainment

4. Cobalt targets and objectives

Healthcare
Since the beginning of 2017, our researchers have studied over 60 unique samples of phishing
messages sent as part of Cobalt campaigns. These messages were sent to over 3,000 people in 12
countries. The addresses include corporate addresses but also personal addresses, since employees
often can check their email on work computers.

Notably, Cobalt attacks government organizations and ministries in order to use them as a stepping
stone for other targets. 

In early 2017, we noted that the Cobalt group was actively registering illegitimate domains. As soon as
these domains were used to send phishing mailings, we notified the security departments of the�
targeted companies, as well as the FinCERT of the Russian Central Bank. Thanks to this timely
intervention, the domains were blocked before the attackers could make use of them.

Positive Technologies has investigated incidents related to attacks by the Cobalt group at a number of
companies in 2017. In several cases, the attackers compromised company infrastructure and
employee accounts in order to send phishing messages to partner companies (i.e., companies that
have a legitimate pre-existing business relationship with banks) in North and South America, Europe,
CIS countries, and Central and Southeast Asia. Against targets in the CIS countries, the attackers also
used their own infrastructure, which included rented dedicated servers located in North America,
Europe, and Southeast Asia.

Several pieces of information suggest that the team responsible for the technical aspects of attacks
consists of only a handful of people. When the attackers were at their most active inside target
networks, the group would temporarily stop registering domain names and sending phishing mailings.
Activity not aimed at the targeted infrastructure was not detected. The days and times of mailings are
also suggestive in this regard, as described later in this report.

5. Chronology of Cobalt 2017 campaign

https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qavAv92q6YE/WYArywjbGcI/AAAAAAAAGI0/w10YG30okzoW0qt1ufcWnA7jh0OOaEsxQCLcBGAs/s1600/c2.png

The Cobalt group relies on social engineering to penetrate networks—users open malicious
attachments from phishing messages that are disguised by the attackers to resemble messages from
legitimate companies and regulatory authorities. These attachments contain a document file, which�
downloads a dropper from a remote server or contains the dropper in a password-protected archive.
Small in size, a dropper is used to download and run other malicious software (in the case of Cobalt,
the Beacon Trojan).

Preparations and progression of a typical attack are illustrated below.

For information on the actions of Cobalt attackers inside the network of a targeted organization, please
see our previous report. 

The Cobalt group's traditional method—sending messages with forged sender information—has fallen
out of favor. Instead, the group has paid more attention to making sure that messages get delivered by
dodging mail server filters. �

For a targeted mailing ("spear phishing"), the criminals use previously registered domains. A domain
name is chosen to be similar in meaning and spelling to the domain of the real company. For
messages to make it through antispam and antivirus checks, the criminals correctly configure SPF�
entries on the DNS server and indicate the correct DKIM signatures for their messages. This approach
allows bypassing verification of the address of the sender's mail server, but offers digital evidence for�
investigators.

Despite the increased complexity involved, in the first quarter of 2017 the Cobalt group also began to�
attack various companies that partner with banks, then sending phishing messages from these
partners' infrastructures using the hacked accounts and mail servers of real employees. 

6. Cobalt attack methods

1. Partner phishing

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hl7-URS72ws/WYAsN463lBI/AAAAAAAAGI8/xxIVhgAt-aULVrBZ4Bim-O8JNwbpqi2-ACLcBGAs/s1600/c4.png
https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Cobalt-Snatch-eng.pdf


This approach ensures that recipients are likely to trust the sender and has a number of advantages:

1. Attackers get information stored on the servers and in the databases of the compromised
partner organization. This information can be used to create convincing phishing messages.

2. Attackers obtain access to employee accounts on workstations and mail servers, giving phishing
messages a high degree of trust and plausibility among potential recipients.

3. Messages from partners are not blocked by mail server filters.�

The attackers carefully choose subject lines, recipient addresses, and attachment names
that will "fly below the radar" so that recipients open the attachments enclosed with�
phishing messages.

Today, Cobalt uses phishing mailings at practically all stages of targeted attacks on banks.

1. Initial compromise starts with one or more workstations at a partner organization, which have been
infected via phishing.

A message informing of "missed payments"

Instructions for connecting to a payment gateway—supposedly

2. The attack against the partner organization is then developed by means of internal mailings
containing malicious documents supposedly from colleagues, management, or IT.

"Documents requested by the head of the department"

A message claiming to inform of payroll changes

3. Malicious messages are sent from the partner's infrastructure to banks and other financial�
organizations.

A password-protected archive (with the password "doc") supposedly containing an invoice for ATM
maintenance

In early 2017, 60 percent of phishing messages from Cobalt related to cooperation and service terms
between banks and their partners. 

In 2017 Cobalt began to use security anxieties as an attack vector. The group has sent messages from
illegitimate domains posing as VISA, MasterCard, and FinCERT units of the Russian Central Bank and
National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 

Broken English and copied boilerplate text can be convincing in the right circumstances

https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AoN1LM5sVIA/WYAuHrSyOVI/AAAAAAAAGJg/QGALbvBVOz4JgOmPX01WFEgKuj6RfWVYgCLcBGAs/s1600/c10.png

A fake FinCERT message

In Russia, this was a particularly ironic "twist" since FinCERT had been actively warning financial�
companies about the Cobalt threat. So the group took advantage of such anxiety to send messages to
banks with malicious documents, supposedly on how to keep bank systems safe

A vague warning that asks the user to act immediately

So by creating counterfeit domains superficially similar to those of real companies, the criminals use�
the imprimatur of well-known organizations to convince users to open dangerous attachments. 

Since real messages from colleagues and partners usually arrive during working hours, the criminals
structured the mailings so that employees would receive them during working hours (no matter in
which time zone the attackers themselves were located).

Most messages were received in the afternoon—the reason being that employees tend to be less
vigilant, and therefore more susceptible to phishing, as the evening approaches. 

We noticed a slight variation in tactics against North American companies. Messages targeting U.S.
and Canadian organizations were sent from the compromised infrastructure of a European partner. For
the phishing messages to be plausibly European in origin, the criminals performed the mailing during
European working hours, due to which the targets received emails in the early waking hours in the
U.S. and Canada.

2. Malicious attachments

To ensure remote access to the workstation of an employee at a target organization, the Cobalt group
(as in previous years) uses Beacon, a Trojan available as part of commercial penetration testing
software Cobalt Strike.

The Trojan is delivered and run with the help of a special dropper. The dropper consists of .scr or .exe
files that are placed on the victim's computer in one of the following ways:�

1. In a password-protected ZIP archive, the password to which is given in the text of the phishing
message.

2. Downloaded from a hacked website when a malicious attachment (.doc, .xls, .rtf) is opened from
the phishing message. 

3. Downloaded from a hacked website based on commands coded in a LNK file that is in a ZIP�
archive attached to the message.

Poorly protected websites are compromised by the attackers and used, in essence, as file�
hosts for spreading malicious files in attacks against banks.�

52 percent of the Cobalt phishing messages reviewed by our researchers contained Microsoft Word
documents.

The malicious Microsoft Office documents that trigger download of the dropper are created using the�
Ancalog and Microsoft Word Intruder (MWI) exploit kits. With these kits, even a hacker without
programming skills can create malicious Word documents and PDF files in an intuitive visual interface�
in just minutes. 

The Cobalt group was one of the first to get their hands on a restricted version of MWI that can create�
documents exploiting the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-0199. Since the version in question was sold
on an individual basis to customers well known to the developer, there may be a relationship between
the Cobalt group and developer of MWI. One instructive fact in this regard is that less than a week
passed between announcement of a new MWI version and use by Cobalt of attachments exploiting
vulnerability CVE-2017-0199.

https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-325FNUff9qw/WYAvrnHOIiI/AAAAAAAAGKM/l-_pUx9_c34eYJoVBKnunz-ysv6dXwExACLcBGAs/s1600/c21.png

https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/microsoft-word-intruder-integrates-cve-2017-0199-utilized-cobalt-group-target


MWI is positioned by its developer as a tool for performing APT attacks; if the software is instead used
to create files for mass spamming, the developer revokes the license. For users of the restricted�
version of MWI, the developer offers a sort of "scrubbing" so that files will not be flagged by currently��
available antivirus scanners. 

The MWI developer boasting of the "product" online

Malicious documents sent by Cobalt to banks and their partners use exploits for
vulnerabilities CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2012-0158 in order to
download and run the dropper on the victim system.

An official-seeming document about how to pay overdue debts�

When the attachment is opened, malicious code is run. This code takes advantage of vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Office to download the dropper from a remote server and �run it. After the code finishes�
running, a decoy document (such as shown in the screenshot) is displayed.

The attackers upload files to vulnerable sites in advance, from where the files can be later downloaded��

to victim systems during an attack. Therefore we urge website owners to be vigilant in securing their
sites: if weak protections cause a site to become a staging ground for malware, regulators may block
the site or law enforcement may seize server equipment as part of a criminal investigation. Public
knowledge of such incidents is likely to cause severe damage to company reputation.

Usually Cobalt phishing messages are sent in several waves. In the first wave, the criminals send�
Microsoft Office documents created using the described exploit kits.�

If there are no "hits" from targeted users within 24 hours of a mailing (this is possible if a company has
up-to-date versions of Microsoft Office that are free of the vulnerabilities targeted by the exploit�
builders), the attackers send a second wave.

Attached to the messages is a dropper, consisting of .exe or .scr executable files, in a password-�
protected archive. By placing the files in an archive, the attackers can bypass some filtering and��
antivirus systems. Solutions are available for real-time scanning of encrypted archives (when the
password is indicated in the body of the message, as is the case here) but organizations making use
of such software are few and far between.

In addition, we have observed a separate mailing in which the attached archives contained LNK files;�
as in all the other cases, these files are used to download the Beacon dropper. �

Since a Cobalt mailing is sent to thousands of recipients, the group clearly is using some sort of
automation. Based on analysis of the phishing messages, we believe that the messages are sent from
phishing domains with the help of alexusMailer v2.0, a freely available PHP script used to send emails
anonymously. 

alexusMailer and other scripts are available on forums

The script includes support for multithreaded sending, a visual editor for messages, import of recipient
lists and other fields from files, templates, attaching any number of files to a message, and more.���
Users can distribute sending tasks over a number of servers and set a delay for message sending.

3. Cobalt infrastructure

alexusMailer interface

However, when messages are sent with alexusMailer, the message header contains an artifact: the X-
PHP-Originating-Script field contains the name of the file of the PHP script that was used to send the��
messages. This means that on servers used for sending, the php.ini configuration file is set to log��
outgoing mail.

The Cobalt group uses widely availably public mail services, as well as services that allow anonymous
registration of temporary addresses. Some of the domains used for reply addresses in Cobalt mailings
include: TempMail (@doanart.com, @rootfest.net), Mail.com (@mail.com), AT&T Mail (@att.net,
@sbcglobal.net), and Yahoo! (@ymail.com). These same services were used by Cobalt to create
email addresses when registering domains.

Based on the times at which the domains in the Cobalt infrastructure were registered, we found that
the attackers tended to register domains towards the beginning of the week. This enables us to
speculate on their working schedule:

− On weekdays, the attackers actively register domains, prepare hacking tools, and (less
often) send phishing mailings.

− At the end of the week, the group concentrates on sending out mailings and advancing
their attacks within the infrastructure of compromised organizations.

− Since phishing mailings are sent out during working hours, domains are usually
registered during the interval from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM (UTC+0), which coincides with the
end of the working day in European countries.

It would seem that after registering a domain at the beginning of the week, the Cobalt group takes
some time to prepare for their upcoming phishing campaign, which as noted usually comes at the end
of the week. On average, the time from domain registration to the first phishing mailing with that same�
domain is four days. 

Our researchers discovered a number of Cobalt phishing domains before the group was able to use
them in its phishing campaigns. By acting quickly, it was possible to block the domains.

Working in cooperation with industry regulators in Russia and other countries, we have succeeded in
disabling delegation for all .ru domains and most other top-level domains known to be associated with
Cobalt. 

The barrier to entry for would-be cybercriminals keeps falling every year. No longer do hackers need to
look for zero-day vulnerabilities and expensive tools to perform attacks. Instead, all they require are
basic programming skills, commercially available software, and instructions posted on the Internet.

Banks and other companies must realize that attackers are constantly refining the tools and�
techniques they use. In today's environment, a company can fall victim just by getting caught in the
middle as attackers scout for stepping stones to reach their ultimate target. That's why responsible
companies can no longer remain complacent about security and pretend that hackers go after only
large companies and banks, or target only far-away areas of the world. No matter their industry or
ownership—whether banks, state-owned organizations, or whatever else—companies must keep
protection of their digital infrastructure current and proactively update their software and operating
systems. Employees must be trained to increase their security awareness and resist phishing
attempts. Moreover, scanning should go beyond just incoming messages and attachments to include
outgoing messages, with retrospective analysis. Public-facing web applications must also be protected
—if company infrastructure or sites are compromised by an attacker, this can wound company
reputation, cause blocking of company servers, trigger a drop in search engine ratings, and drive away
customers.

Information about the extent of losses caused by the Cobalt group in 2017 is not yet available.
Perhaps warnings by bank regulators headed off some of the group's efforts. We will continue to
monitor the Cobalt group and report new details as they become available. Judging by the scale of
Cobalt campaigns worldwide, multimillion-dollar losses by banks are a real possibility. And if attacks on
financial exchanges are successful, the consequences will include not only direct losses to individual�
companies, but rate turbulence on world currency markets.
