This blog was authored by Paul Rascagneres

Talos has discovered an unknown Remote Administration Tool that we believe has been in
use for over 3 years. During this time it has managed to avoid scrutiny by the security
community. The current version of the malware allows the operator to steal files,�
keystrokes, perform screenshots, and execute arbitrary code on the infected host. Talos
has named this malware KONNI. 

Throughout the multiple campaigns observed over the last 3 years, the actor has used an
email attachment as the initial infection vector. They then use additional social engineering
to prompt the target to open a .src file, display a decoy document to the users, and finally��
execute the malware on the victim's machine. The malware infrastructure of the analysed
samples was hosted by a free web hosting provider: 000webhost. The malware has
evolved over time. In this article, we will analyse this evolution:

at the beginning the malware was only an information stealer without remote
administration
it moved from a single file malware to a dual file malware (an executable and a��
dynamic library)
the malware has supported more and more features over the time
the decoy documents have become more and more advanced
The different versions contain copy/pasted code from previous versions.
Moreover the new version searches for files generated by previous versions.�
(This implies that the malware has been used several times against the same
targets)

This evolution is illustrated across 4 campaigns: one in 2014, one in 2016 and finally two in�
2017. The decoy document of the 2 last campaigns suggests that the targets are public
organisations. Both documents contained email addresses, phone numbers and contacts
of members of official organizations such as United Nations, UNICEF, and Embassies�
linked to North Korea.

KONNI: A Malware Under The Radar For Years

Executive Summary

https://www.blogger.com/profile/10073079939160046441


In this campaign, the dropper filename was beauty.src. Based on the compilation date of�
the two binaries, this campaign took place in September 2014. Once executed, two files�
were dropped on the targeted system: a decoy document (a picture) and a fake
svchost.exe binary. Both files were stored in "C:\Windows". The picture is a Myanmar�
temple:

The fake svchost binary is the KONNI malware. The first task of the malware is to�
generate an ID to identify the infected system. This ID is generated based on the
installation date of the system, as found in the registry
(HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\InstallDate). The second task of
malware is to ping the CC and get orders. The malware includes 2 domains:

phpschboy[.]prohosts[.]org
jams481[.]site[.]bz

The developer used the Microsoft Winsocks API to handle the network connection.
Surprisingly, this isn't the easiest or the most efficient technical choice for HTTP�
connection. The malware samples we analysed connected to only one URI: <c2-
domain>/login.php.

3 Years Of Campaigns

2014 CAMPAIGN: FATAL BEAUTY

This version of KONNI is not designed to execute code on the infected system. The
purpose is to be executed only once and steal data on the infected system, here are the
main features:

Keyloggers
Clipboard stealer
Firefox profiles and cookies stealer�
Chrome profiles and cookies stealer�
Opera profiles and cookies stealer�

The malware internally uses several temporary files:�

spadmgr.ocx
screentmp.tmp (log file of the keylogger)�
solhelp.ocx
sultry.ocx

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5TVPWki7b58/WQn3elJnQBI/AAAAAAAAAIA/z0OtfDF05mY8TsdUb6H4VH0YexrNxFMtwCLcB/s1600/image8.png

sultry.ocx

The name of the .src file was directly linked to tension between North Korea and USA in�
March 2016: more information. Based on the compilation dates of the binaries, the
campaign took place in the same period. An interesting fact: the dropped library was
compiled in 2014 and appears in our telemetry in August 2015. Indicating that this library
was probably used in another campaign.

The .src file contains 2 Office documents. The first document was in English and a second���
in Russian. In the sample only the English version can be displayed to the user (that is
hardcoded in the sample):

The Russian document is not used by the sample, we assume that the author of the
malware forgot to remove the resource containing the Russia decoy document:

2016 CAMPAIGN: "HOW CAN NORTH KOREAN HYDROGEN BOMB WIPE OUT
MANHATTAN.SRC"

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-claims-it-could-wipe-out-manhattan-with-a-hydrogen-bomb/2016/03/13/3834cd54-e919-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html

The malware author changed the malware architecture, this version is divided in two
binaries:

conhote.dll
winnit.exe

Another difference is the directory where the files are dropped, it's no longer C:\Windows�
but rather the local setting of the current user (%USERPROFILE%\Local
Settings\winnit\winnit.exe). Thanks to this modification, the malware can be executed with�
a non-administrator account. The .dll file is executed by the .exe file. In this version, a��
shortcut is created in order to launch winnit.exe in the following path
%USERPROFILE%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Anti virus service.lnk. As you can see
the attacker has went to great lengths to disguise his service as a legitimate Antivirus
Service by using the name 'Anti virus service.lnk'. This is of course simple but often it can
be enough for a user to miss something malicious by name.

As in the previous version, the ID of the infected system is generated with exactly the
same method. The C2 is different and the analysed version this time only contains a single
domain:

dowhelsitjs[.]netau[.]net

In this version, the developer used a different API, the Wininet API which make more
sense for Web requests. Moreover the C2 infrastructure evolved too, more .php files are�
available through the web hosting:

<c2-domain>/login.php (for infected machine registration)
<c2-domain>/upload.php (for uploading files on the C2)�
<c2-domain>/download.php (for downloading file from the C2)�

https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMsAVKE0C78/WQn3x9X4xaI/AAAAAAAAAIM/IxEujslUVbY8MNHzt08QjAayDFvkutFXwCLcB/s1600/image1.png


This version includes the stealer features mentioned in the previous version and
additionally Remote Administration Tool features such as file uploading/download and�
arbitrary command execution. The library is only used to perform keylogging and clipboard
stealing.  Indeed, the malware author moved this part of the code from the core of the
malware to a library. An interesting element is that the malware looks for filenames created�
with the previous version of KONNI. This implies that the malware targeted the same
people as the previous version and they are designed to work together.

The malware internally uses the following files:�

solhelp.ocx
sultry.ocx
helpsol.ocx
psltre.ocx
screentmp.tmp (log file of the keylogger)�
spadmgr.ocx
apsmgrd.ocx
wpg.db

R C _ O F F I C E _ C O O R D I N A T I O N _ A S S O C I A T E . S R C

In this campaign, the malware author uses the following name: Pyongyang Directory
Group email April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.src. The decoy document�
shown after infection is an Office document containing email addresses, phone numbers�
and contacts of members of official organizations such as the United Nations, UNICEF,�
Embassies linked to North Korea.

2017 CAMPAIGNS

The .src files drops two files: an executable and a library. As in the previous version, the��
persistence is achieved by a Windows shortcut (in this case adobe distillist.lnk). Contrary
to the previous version, the developers moved the core of malware to the library. The
executable performs the following tasks:

If the system is a 64-bit version of Windows, it downloads and executes a
specific 64-bit version of the malware thanks to a powershell script:�

Loading the dropped library

The library contains the same features as the previous version as well as new ones. This
version of KONNI is the most advanced with better coding. The malware configuration�
contains one Command and Control:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P-aJotcfevU/WQn4SzzjtyI/AAAAAAAAAIU/D86V_AnDWs8UTD88Y1NOjBf-WgKuL9qRQCLcB/s1600/image12.png

pactchfilepacks[.]net23[.]net�

A new URI is available:

<c2-domain>/uploadtm.php

This URI is used with a new feature implemented in this version: the malware is able to
perform screenshot (thanks to the GDI API) and uploads it thank to this URL. The malware
checks if a file used on a previous version of KONNI is available on the system. Here is�
the complete list of files internally used by the RAT:�

error.tmp (the log file of the keylogger)�
tedsul.ocx
helpsol.ocx
trepsl.ocx
psltred.ocx
solhelp.ocx
sulted.ocx

The handling of instructions has improved too. Here are the 7 actions that the infected
machine can be instructed to perform:

Delete a specific file;��
Upload a specific file based on a filename;���
Upload a specific file based on the full path name;��
Create a screenshot and uploads it on the C2;
Get system information;
Download a file from the Internet;�
Execute a command;

This graph shows the decision tree:

When the attacker wants to gather information on the infected system (action 5), it
retrieves the following information:

Hostname
IP address
Computer name
Username name
Connected drive
OS version
Architecture
Start menu programs
Installed software

The last identified campaign where KONNI was used was named Inter Agency List and�
Phonebook - April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.src. This file drops exactly the��
same files than the previous campaign but the decoy document is different:�

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lOvDJssUuUM/WQn5QUrtNeI/AAAAAAAAAIk/--cfD7pclkkOFZQTa1gaHQRkPPikoijOACLcB/s1600/image9.png


This document contains the name, phone number and email address of members of
agencies, embassies and organizations linked to North Korea.

The analysis shows us the evolution of KONNI over the last 3 years. The last campaign
was started a few days ago and is still active. The infrastructure remains up and running at
the time of this post. The RAT has remained under the radar for multiple years. An
explanation could be the fact that the campaign was very limited nature, which does not
arouse suspicion.

This investigation shows that the author has evolved technically (by implementing new
features) and in the quality of the decoy documents. The campaign of April 2017 used
pertinent documents containing potentially sensitive data. Moreover the metadata of the
Office document contains the names of people who seems to work for a public�
organization. We don't know if the document is a legitimate compromised document or a
fake that the attacker has created in an effort to be credible.

Clearly the author has a real interest in North Korea, with 3 of the 4 campaigns are linked
to North Korea.

The following graph show the evolution of KONNI over the last 3 years:
