OSX Malware Linked to Operation Emmental Hijacks User
Network Traffic�

Posted in: Malware Author: Rubio Wu (Threats Analyst)

The OSX_DOK malware (Detected by Trend Micro as OSX_DOK.
C)  showcases sophisticated features such as certificate abuse and
security software evasion that affects machines using Apple’s OSX
operating system. This malware, which specifically targets Swiss
banking users, uses a phishing campaign to drop its payload, which
eventually results in the hijacking of a user’s network traffic using a
Man-in-the- Middle (MitM) attack. OSX_DOK.C seems to be another
version of WERDLOD (Detected by Trend Micro as
TROJ_WERDLOD), which is a malware that was used during the
Operation Emmental campaigns—an interesting development that
we will tackle further in this blog post.

Arrival Method and Infection Flow

Figure 1: OSX_DOK.C infection routine for Mac systems

OSX_DOK.C first arrives via a phishing email that contains certain files labeled as either .zip or .docx
files. The sample we analyzed was a purported message from a police inspector in Zurich allegedly
claiming to unsuccessfully contact the recipient. The email also comes with two files attached claiming
to contain questions for the user: one is a .zip file, which is a fake OSX app, while the other is a .docx
file used to target Windows operating systems using WERDLOD. Both of these samples work as
Banking Trojans and provide similar functionalities.

Some examples of the files used in the email attachment include the following:

Zahlungsinformationen 01.06.2017.zip

Zahlungsinformationen digitec.zip

zip

Dokument 09.06.2017.zip

Dokument 09.06.2017.docx

docx

docx

06.2017.docx

Once the docx file included in the phishing email is clicked, a warning window will pop up:

Figure 5: Fake document file

Mac OSX will run the application if it passes certificates. In this case, the malware is signed off by a
“developer”, which may actually be a dummy account or that of a compromised user. In addition, the
time stamp on the CA is new, which might mean that it was obtained specifically for this attack.

The fake certificate imitates the COMODO root certificate. Take note that the fake certificate does not
contain a COMODO Certificate Authority seal that certifies its validity, as seen in the comparison below:

Figure 6: Comparison of a Fake COMODO (left) root certificate vs a genuine COMODO certificate
(right)

We noticed that this malware will not work for Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome since these two
browsers have their own root certificates. Of all the major browsers, only Safari uses the system’s
certificates.

We observed the attacker targeting both Windows and Mac OSX in the same spam mail on June 9,
2017. There is a file shortcut embedded in the malicious .docx file—one that will download an
executable file from Dropbox—that executes once clicked by the user. The functionalities are similar to
the malicious app provided, which includes installing tor and proxy.

We have already notified Dropbox about the use of its service for this malware. Dropbox has already
taken down the links.

The malware will install two proxies running on local host port 5555 and 5588. All of the traffic will be
hijacked into the first proxy (port 5555) with the victim’s external IP address as parameter.



Figure 7: Installing proxies on local host port 5555

The first (port 5555) proxy first finds the IP parameter. If it is not in Switzerland, the traffic will proceed
as normal. If it detects an IP located in Switzerland, the malware will run an obfuscated JavaScript code
and find its visiting domain. If the domain is in the target, the malware will perform a MitM attack and
redirect the traffic to the second proxy (port 5588), which routes the traffic to the Tor network. The
purpose of these steps is to target users in Switzerland and hijack their traffic

After deobfuscating the malware, we found the target domains:

Figure 8: Hardcoded list of target banking websites in Switzerland

The target domain’s visitors will be redirected into an e-banking login page that looks and acts normally,
but is located on dark web sites.

However, once the victim enters an account and password. A window will pop out.

Figure 9: Hijacking connection to EKR bank

The pop-out window is just smoke and mirrors, where nothing actually happens once the countdown
timer reaches zero.

We analyzed the webpage and found attackers injecting a script into the webpage. Once the user
enters an account and password, it will initiate POST using AJAX. The POST message is sent to the
same site as the fake login page—which an attacker can control inside the Tor network.



Figure 10: Post message carrying argument

We decoded the data section and found not only the account and password, but that it also
fingerprinted the user’s browser and system information.

While Operation Emmental was able to bypass two-way authentication by tricking its victims into
installing a fake app, we have not observed OSX_DOK.C doing this. However, since they can inject
code into the webpage, it means they have the ability to do this as well.

Performing static analysis on OSX_DOK.C

We performed static analysis on the sample and found it packed by Ultimate Packer for Executables
(UPX), an open source executable packer that can often be abused by malware. We successfully
unpacked the initial sample we found dropped by the UPX unpacker.

The malware is not obfuscated so we easily found interesting strings here. We can see that the
malware relies on bash shell for most of its setup.

Figure 11: OSX_DOK.C strings

We were not able to unpack the sample discovered after June 9, 2017. The UPX gave a warning
message about memory buffer overflow. The malware author seemingly made unpacking the malware
more difficult to slow down or even evade the antivirus engine’s scanning process. The packer is the
same but the malware tries to exploit the undiscovered bug in the UPX library that causes unpack
failure. We have reported the issues to the UPX team, and they have already fixed it.

The impacted versions of the UPX library are 3.94, 3.93, and 3.92. This technique enables the malware
to efficiently run while evading unpacking techniques from the AntiVirus-integrated UPX library.

Connecting OSX_DOK.C with WERDLOD

As mentioned earlier, we believe that OSX_DOK.C might be the MAC OSX version of WERDLOD, an
online banking malware that used the same techniques as Operation Emmental. Other research have
also connected the OSX malware and Retefe (the external term used for WERDLOD) via similarities in
their behavior.

While OSX_DOK.C is designed for MAC OSX, which is a Unix-like system, WERDLOD is designed for
Windows. But in terms of features and behaviors, these two malware are very similar. Here is a list of
their similarities.

Both malware kill all current browsers before installing fake certificates:

Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C are designed to kill the browser process before installing fake
certificates. While WERDLOD kills processes for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, OSX_DOK.C
does the same on Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.

Both malware share the same proxy settings and script:

While WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C use different codes (since they target different operating systems),
they have similar proxy settings and script formats. In particular, WERDLOD uses scripts running on
hxxp://127.0.0.1:555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} as proxy:

http://brycampbell.co.uk/new-blog/2017/5/17/retefe-v-osxdok-part-2


Figure 12 : Local Area Network (LAN) settings

Comparing it to OSX_DOK.C, we can see that it uses the same script format:

Figure 13: OSX_DOK.C network settings

Both malware have similar targets:

Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C targeted financial institutions, with a particular focus on banks in
Switzerland. Further analysis of both malware revealed that their main targets are very similar, as seen
in the screenshot below. While it’s possible that this is a coincidence, the rest of the evidence makes it
unlikely for these two malware to target the same organizations by chance.

Figure 14: OSX_DOK.C target banks

Given the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C, it is reasonable to assume that the latter
is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign. To further illustrate, here is a timeline of
Operation Emmental and its potential relationship to OSX_DOK.C:

Mitigation and Trend Micro Solutions

Despite phishing incidents for Mac devices being rarer than their Windows counterparts, users should
still be aware that attackers can target them at any moment. By implementing best practices for
phishing-type attacks—such as refraining from downloading files unless they are absolutely certain that
they come from trustworthy sources—users can avoid being victimized by malware such as
OSX_DOK.C that prey on users who lack awareness of phishing strategies.

In addition, end users can also benefit from security solutions such as Trend Micro Home Security for
Mac, which provides comprehensive security and multi-device protection against viruses, ransomware,
malicious websites, and identity thieves. It also provides secure storage of passwords and other
sensitive information. Trend Micro™ Mobile Security for Apple devices (available on the App Store) can
monitor and block phishing attacks and other malicious URLs.

For enterprises, Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Suites with XGen™ security, which support Mac
systems, infuse high-fidelity machine learning into a blend of threat protection techniques to eliminate
security gaps across any user activity and any endpoint.
