SideWinder Uses South Asian Issues for Spear Phishing, Mobile
Attacks
While tracking the activities of the SideWinder group, we identi�ed a server used to deliver a malicious LNK �le and host multiple credential phishing pages.
In addition, we also found multiple Android APK �les on their phishing server.

While tracking the activities of the SideWinder group, which has become

infamous for targeting the South Asia region and its surrounding countries, we

identi�ed a server used to deliver a malicious LNK �le and host multiple

credential phishing pages. We learned that these pages were copied from their

victims’ webmail login pages and subsequently modi�ed for phishing. We

believe further activities are propagated via spear-phishing attacks.

The group’s targets include multiple government and military units, mainly in

Nepal and Afghanistan.  After the gathered credentials are sent, some of the

phishing pages will redirect victims to di�erent documents or news pages. The

themes and topics of these pages and documents are related to either Covid-

19 or recent territory disputes between Nepal, Pakistan, India, and China.

Furthermore, it seems that these lures are distributed via phishing links.

We also found multiple Android APK �les on their phishing server. While some

of them are benign, we also discovered malicious �les created with Metasploit.

One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for

gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political map dispute, which

seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spear-

phishing portion. We believe these applications are still under development

and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future.

SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a

report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to attack

mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh,

and China using lure �les related to Covid-19.

Analysis of the malicious document

The use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common

infection vectors. We collected several di�erent samples from the campaign,

including:

1.      An LNK �le that downloads an RTF �le and drops a JavaScript �le

2.      A ZIP �le containing an LNK �le, which downloads an HTA �le (with

JavaScript)

3.      An RTF �le that drops a JavaScript �le

4.      A PDF �le with an embedded JavaScript stream

5.      A DOCX �le with an external link to an OLE object (RTF �le), which

contains and drops a JavaScript �le

Figure 1. An example of a downloaded ZIP �le containing an LNK �le that is used to download a malicious
HTA �le

All of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of �les and

then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used to install the

main backdoor + stealer.

The downloaded RTF �les exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a

�le named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor + stealer into a

folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to

execute the dropped �les at a later time.

Figure 2. A scheduled task with a command to execute the dropped backdoor + stealer

The content of the newly created folder contains a few �les, including

Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard,

FA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326E

Figure 3. List of dropped �les

This application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which

sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports. 

Figure 4. DUser library as DelayImport of shell32 library

However, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library

decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp �le in the same directory.

Figure 5. Algorithm for decrypting both main backdoor + stealer and con�guration

The decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the �rst 32 bytes

from the encrypted �le and the payload are the remaining bytes. The

decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.

Figure 6. Decrypted main SystemApp with listing its classes and resources

In Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted con�guration.

After decryption (using the same principle as with the main backdoor +

stealer), the con�guration reveals which �le formats the attackers are

targeting.

Figure 7. The decrypted con�guration

The main functions of the backdoor + stealer are: 

1) Downloading the .NET executable and running it 

2) Collecting system information and uploading it to the command-and-control

(C&C) server 

3) Uploading selected �les to the C&C server

The collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json

library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes information such as

privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs,

running processes, processor information, operating system information,

timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in

Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop, Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads,

Users\%USERNAME%\Documents, Users\%USERNAME%\Contacts, as well as

information on all drives and installed apps.

The spear-phishing attack

We found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that

was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The subdomains of

these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their

victims’ mail servers. For example, “mail-nepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was

created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain

“mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”.  Digging deeper, we found that it hosted several

phishing pages.

These pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then

modi�ed for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials.

Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the

victims, �nding the original webmail servers that they copied to make these

phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting.

Analysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to

the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims sent out their

login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to

documents or news pages. These documents and news are probably

interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and

log in to the phishing pages. While several of the documents are related to

Android applications

We also identi�ed multiple Android APK �les on their server. Interestingly,

these Android applications still seem to be under the initial development

phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no

practical function for users.

We noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion

Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP demonstrates

login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling

application for the Indian-Nepalese political map dispute. The �rst application

is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one

starts with an explanation of “Opinion Writing,” followed by a survey.

Figure 12. Non-malicious applications “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll”

Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will

load extra code from the remote server con�gured in the sample. While we

were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests

numerous privacy-related permissions like location, contacts, call logs, etc., we

can infer that it goes after the user’s private data. These two samples appear

to be debug versions as they have no activities or any other component except

Metasploit.

SideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the

campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs disguised as

photography and �le manager tools to lure users into downloading them.

Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the malicious APKs launch a

series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to

stealthily deploy the payload, as well as exploiting CVE-2019-2215 and

MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to

gather information from the compromised device and then send it back to its

C&C server.

In the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user

information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on the Google

Play Store, all the APK �les found on their server are not mature enough for a

deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the initial stage, and the

payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being re�ned further.

Conclusion

As seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous

development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending topics like Covid-

19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise

their targets. Therefore, we recommend that users and organizations be

vigilant and follow social engineering best practices to protect themselves from

these kinds of campaigns.
