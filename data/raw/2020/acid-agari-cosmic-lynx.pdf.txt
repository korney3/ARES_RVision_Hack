For more than a year, this is a line we have used over and over again, expecting that some 
of the world’s most dangerous cybercriminals would move into the world of business email 
compromise (BEC) because the return on investment for basic social engineering attacks is 
much higher than more sophisticated malware-based attacks. For the first time, this report 
shows how these expectations have now become a reality, detailing a Russian criminal 
organization we call Cosmic Lynx.

We have observed more than 200 BEC campaigns linked to Cosmic Lynx since July 
2019, targeting individuals in 46 countries on six continents. Unlike most BEC groups that 
are relatively target agnostic, Cosmic Lynx has a clear target profile: large, multinational 
organizations. Nearly all of the organizations Cosmic Lynx has targeted have a significant global 
presence and many of them are Fortune 500 or Global 2000 companies. The target employees 
of Cosmic Lynx are senior-level executives. Like other BEC groups, it seems Cosmic Lynx 
identifies employees to target based on their title. Three quarters of employees targeted by 
Cosmic Lynx hold the titles of Vice President, General Manager, or Managing Director.

Cosmic Lynx employs a dual impersonation scheme. The pretext of their attacks is that the 
target organization is preparing to close an acquisition with an Asian company as part of a 
corporate expansion. First, they impersonate a company’s CEO, asking the target employee to 
work with “external legal counsel” to coordinate the payments needed to close the acquisition. 
Then, Cosmic Lynx hijacks the identity of a legitimate attorney at a UK-based law firm whose 
job it is to facilitate the transaction. Cosmic Lynx prefers to use mule accounts in Hong Kong to 
receive stolen funds. The group is actively resistant to using mule accounts in the United States, 
but has provided secondary accounts located in Hungary, Portugal, and Romania.

Cosmic Lynx exploits DMARC controls to spoof the email addresses of impersonated CEOs, 
making their attacks appear much more authentic. For organizations that have implemented an 
established DMARC policy set to reject (p=reject) or quarantine (p=quarantine), Cosmic Lynx 
modifies the display name impersonating a CEO to include their email address, which still gives 
it the look that the email is coming from the CEO’s account.

Domains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to mimic secure email and network 
infrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]
com). The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address usually references celestial 
bodies, like planets and stars--hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx-- similar to the naming 
convention of some SMTP or DNS name servers. 

To make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in Whois records, Cosmic 
Lynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and 
anonymous domain provider. Cosmic Lynx’s infrastructure has also been linked to other types 
of malicious activity, including Emotet and Trickbot banking Trojans, Android click fraud 
malware, a popular carding marketplace, and Russian fake document websites.

Executive Summary
At some point, Russian and Eastern European cybercriminals are going to start 
thinking to themselves, ‘Why am I spending all of this time and money setting 
up infrastructure and hiring malware developers when I can just send someone 
an email, ask them to send me money, and they’ll do it.’

The Missing Lynx
Inside a Cosmic Lynx Attack

Every single day, researchers in the Agari Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID) engage with 
dozens of BEC scammers who have tried (and failed) to target Agari customers. In doing so, 
we collect rich intelligence that allows us to better understand cybercriminal group operations, 
uncover the identities of those involved in the criminal schemes, discover and track the 
evolution of their methods over time, and unravel the financial infrastructure they use to launder 
stolen proceeds.

Over the last year, ACID has identified more than 200 BEC campaigns targeting businesses 
all over the world that are attributed to a sophisticated group of BEC actors we refer to as 
“Cosmic Lynx.” This report details the tactics used by the group as well as our assessment 
about the attribution of the group’s location.

The pretext used in nearly all Cosmic Lynx BEC attacks is that the company is preparing to 
close an acquisition with an Asian company as part of corporate expansion. Impersonating the 
company’s CEO, Cosmic Lynx asks the target employee to work with “external legal counsel” 
to coordinate the payments necessary to close the acquisition. Of course, due to the sensitive 
nature of this acquisition, the target employee is asked to keep the details of this transaction 
confidential until it has been finalized.

One of the first things that stands out in a Cosmic Lynx attack is that they are extremely well-
written. Unlike most BEC emails that are riddled with misspelled words and grammatical errors, 
Cosmic Lynx emails are usually very detailed and written in nearly perfect English. In some 
cases, Cosmic Lynx uses words that are likely not in most people’s vocabulary, like “accretive” 
and “synergistic,” and uses them in their proper context. It should be noted that although 
Cosmic Lynx’s targets are located all over the world, nearly all of the emails sent by the group 
are written in English. The only exception to this we have identified were a handful of emails 
written in French that were sent to a few targets in France.

Once the “CEO” has introduced the request to the target employee, the next step in a Cosmic 
Lynx attack is to introduce the “lawyer” that will be assisting with the payments for the fake 
acquisition. The “lawyer” generally introduces himself in a separate email and gives the target a 
general overview of how the transaction will proceed. 

This is where Cosmic Lynx deploys their second round of impersonation. Instead of developing 
an independent legal persona, Cosmic Lynx hijacks the identities of real attorneys at high-
profile law firms to add another layer of legitimacy to their attack. Nearly all of the attorneys 
impersonated by Cosmic Lynx are based in the United Kingdom.

Cosmic Lynx employs two strategies to make communications from the impersonated lawyer 
more convincing. First, the group registers a domain that closely resembles the law firm’s actual 
domain and create an email address on this domain to communicate with a target. For example, 
if an attorney’s real email address is john.doe@lawfirm.com, Cosmic Lynx would create an 
account like john.doe@lawfirmllp.com to communicate with an employee. 

Second, to mimic the impersonated attorney’s communication patterns as closely as possible, 
Cosmic Lynx creates a detailed email signature that contains a picture of the impersonated 
lawyer, a link to the legitimate law firm’s website, and a confidentiality disclaimer. An analysis 
of the signatures indicates they are likely created using a freely available online signature 
generator. The attorney’s photo is copied directly from the law firm’s actual website.

The final phase of a Cosmic Lynx BEC attack is getting the target employee to send one or 
more payments to mule accounts controlled by the group. A characteristic of Cosmic Lynx 
attacks that sticks out is the amount of money they request. The average amount requested in 
most executive impersonation BEC attacks is $55,000. Cosmic Lynx, on the other hand, asks for 
hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars. 

Based on our engagements with the group, it is clear their preference is to have a target send 
payments to mule accounts located in Hong Kong, which has become a common source of 
international mule accounts over the past few years. In every successful engagement we have 
initiated with Cosmic Lynx, the initial mule account they have provided to us has been located 
in Hong Kong.

To better understand how a BEC threat actor will adapt, we commonly give them reasons why 
a payment to their first mule account is not possible. In typical cases, BEC actors who originally 
provide an international bank account will follow up with a secondary mule account that is 
located in the US or the same country as the target. For Cosmic Lynx, though, they seem to 
be consciously resistant to provide mule accounts in certain countries, like the US. Even when 
we give them no other options, the group actively refuses to disclose mule accounts in the US. 
This could mean that either the group does not have a supply of mules in the US or for other 
reasons, they prefer not to use bank accounts in the US to receive illicit funds. Outside Hong 
Kong, secondary accounts provided by Cosmic Lynx have been located in Hungary, Portugal, 
and Romania.

A Global Threat
A Look at Cosmic Lynx’s Targets

Typical BEC groups tend to be agnostic when selecting targets for their attacks. They are 
more interested in identifying employees who have access to money, regardless if they work 
for a small, five-person company or an organization with thousands of employees. In contrast, 
Cosmic Lynx has a clear target preference: large, multinational organizations. Nearly all of the 
target organizations we have identified have a global presence and many of them are Fortune 
500 or Global 2000 companies. These target organizations are headquartered in 20 countries; 
however, because most of the organizations are global, employees targeted by Cosmic Lynx 
BEC campaigns are located in 46 countries on six continents. Even employees in countries not 
typically seen in phishing campaign targeting sets, like Namibia and Mongolia, were targeted by 
Cosmic Lynx.

To identify employees to target with BEC attacks, groups generally use legitimate commercial 
services that allow them to conduct a finely tuned search for employees based on a number 
of variables, such as title, location, and company revenue. Based on a review of employees 
targeted by Cosmic Lynx, it is clear that they are using a similar service to identify targets 
specifically by their title.

All of the employees targeted in Cosmic Lynx BEC campaigns are senior-level employees at 
a company. Three quarters of employees targeted hold the titles of Vice President, General 
Manager, or Managing Director at a company. Other positions explicitly targeted by Cosmic 
Lynx include CEO (generally, subsidiary or country-level CEOs), CFO, and President. Because 
Cosmic Lynx is focused on large, global companies, another interesting aspect of their attacks 
is that they rarely target employees multiple times. Instead, they will target employees with the 
same title at a company located in different countries.

The DMARC standard was created to prevent malicious actors from directly spoofing an 
organization’s domain when sending an email. The standard was published in 2012 and 
allows organizations to authenticate legitimate email messages and sources for their email-
sending domains and publish explicit policies that instruct mailbox providers what to do with 
inauthentic messages. The most aggressive DMARC policy is “reject” (p=reject), which means 
that email messages that do not pass DMARC authentication will be rejected by a mail server 
and not delivered to a user. In essence, with an effective DMARC policy at reject, cybercriminals 
are not able to directly spoof an organization’s domain.

While spoofed domains can be used to create very realistic-looking phishing emails, very few 
BEC attacks leverage spoofed domains. In our latest quarterly Email Fraud & Identity Deception 
Trends report, we found that 96% of all BEC attacks used free webmail accounts or registered 
domains to send malicious emails.

Cosmic Lynx, though, is part of the 4% of attacks to exploit organizations that do not have an 
established DMARC policy. This enhances the authenticity of their emails by directly spoofing 
the email addresses of CEOs when possible. Based on our analysis of historical Cosmic Lynx 
attacks, it is clear that the group is aware of which target organizations have implemented an 
effective DMARC policy and which organizations have not. 

If a company has not implemented a DMARC policy or has a policy set to monitor-only 
(p=none), Cosmic Lynx will directly spoof the CEO’s email address and set the Reply-To 
email to their operational email account they use to actually correspond with a victim. If an 
organization has an established DMARC policy set to reject or quarantine (p=quarantine), 
Cosmic Lynx will not spoof the sending email address. Instead, the group changes the display 
name impersonating the CEO to include their email address, which still gives the look that the 
email is coming directly from the CEO’s account (e.g., “John Smith - jsmith@acme.com”).

Phishing attacks exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic started to skyrocket in March 2020. 
Malware campaigns, credential phishing lures, and BEC attacks all started adopting COVID-19 
themes as a way to increase the success rate of their attacks. Cosmic Lynx was no different. 

In late-March, the group began inserting language referencing the pandemic into their BEC 
campaign emails as a social-engineering icebreaker that preceded their main request. Because 
COVID-19 has impacted nearly everyone in the world, it afforded Cosmic Lynx an opportunity 
to disarm a target’s suspicions by building rapport with them at the beginning of an initial email 
regardless of where the target was located. Some of the pandemic-themed content used by 
Cosmic Lynx included the following:

The COVID-19 pandemic is a truly unprecedented situation which 
affects us all but we are doing everything possible to provide 
a safe working environment to our people, and to minimize its 
negative impact on our business.

With the unpredictable and fluid situation around COVID-19, 
the world is navigating through an uncertain period with few 
precedents. We are deeply concerned about the pandemic’s 
impact on our business and our employees’ health and have rolled 
out several mitigation measures.

I trust this emails (sic) finds you safe and well. The current situation 
with the COVID-19 virus has all of us worried.

As the peak of the pandemic passed for most countries by late-May, Cosmic Lynx shifted their 
tone and began referencing the reopening of global economies as an introduction to their 
emails. Like the earlier references to COVID-19, these introductions are meant to get a target to 
put down their defenses before the Cosmic Lynx actor gets to what they really want. Some of 
the introductions used by Cosmic Lynx after the COVID-19 peak included the following:

Prior to the global rise of COVID-19, Cosmic Lynx’s emails were rather generic, which makes 
their pivot to pandemic themes that much more notable. Like many cybercriminals out there, 
this indicates they are savvy enough to pay attention to global events and adapt their attacks 
to exploit them.

As the world emerges from lockdown restrictions, we are 
cautiously optimistic that the worst is finally behind us.

“As countries around the world gradually ease lockdown 
restrictions and companies resume business, we must now 
look beyond the crisis and position ourselves for the economic 
recovery.”

“The last many weeks have been very challenging but the worst is 
most likely over as normalcy is gradually returning with countries 
easing restrictions. We anticipate a robust rebound in the economy 
and are seizing the opportunity to further develop our business.”

Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx
A Look at Cosmic Lynx’s Operational Infrastructure

Attacker infrastructure is another one of the key differences between Cosmic Lynx and other 
BEC groups. While most BEC actors tend to gravitate to free webmail accounts or remotely-
hosted cloud services, Cosmic Lynx consistently chooses to host their own email infrastructure 
with a small number of hosting providers. By hosting, managing, controlling, and running 
their own email infrastructure, Cosmic Lynx is able to be more resistant to law enforcement 
operations which may target their campaigns. 

Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx
Email addresses created by Cosmic Lynx to send their campaigns seem to mimic secure email 
and network infrastructure. The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address (the part 
of an email address before the “@”) usually references celestial bodies, like planets and stars-
-hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx--similar to the naming convention of some SMTP or DNS 
name servers. Examples of these mailbox names include “smtp-mars,” “mx-taurus,” “tls-sirius,” 
and gateway-mercury.”

Similarly, domains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to impersonate secure email 
infrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]
com). In some cases, Cosmic Lynx has referenced Fortinet, a US-based cybersecurity that 
offers endpoint security and secure email gateway products, in their domains (e.g., fortinet-
host-protection[.]cc, fortinet-server[.]cc, fortinet-gateway[.]cc). 

See Appendix A for a full list of domains linked to Cosmic Lynx attacks.

Manipulating Email Flow, Not Just for Email Engineers
Most BEC actors simply purchase a domain or use a free webmail account, with attackers 
frequently cycling through accounts and domains as they’re taken down. Cosmic Lynx 
purchases domains too; however, they put much more work and effort into securing the 
infrastructure from outsiders investigating the domains. 

Cosmic Lynx makes heavy use of DNS MX records for their email accounts to manipulate mail 
flow. After Cosmic Lynx registers their domain for a specific campaign, the attackers point the 
top-level domain (TLD) at Cloudflare to make the domain appear more legitimate. Next, the 
attackers create a subdomain to use as the MX record, or the place where emails will be sent 
and delivered. By modifying the IP address that the subdomain is pointing to, Cosmic Lynx is 
able to point part of the domain at seemingly legitimate infrastructure, while running scams 
under the subdomain.

DMARC: Not Just for the Good Guys
While Cosmic Lynx is more than happy to spoof email infrastructure to target an organization 
with a BEC attempt, the attackers aren’t fans of having someone else spoof their infrastructure. 
Cosmic Lynx is able to monitor for any attempts at spoofing their domain by using properly-
configured DMARC policies on their domain infrastructure. In a vast majority of cases, Cosmic 
Lynx DMARC domains are configured to send spoofs to abuse@[domain], with variations 
including legal@[domain] and dmarc@[domain]. By using these email accounts, not only 
does Cosmic Lynx receive a copy of any person trying to spoof them, but they could fool 
unsuspecting users into reporting fraud attacks to them, too.

Additionally, if DMARC is not enabled, anyone is able to spoof the origins of the sending 
domain. By having this security feature disabled, spam bots and other parties are able to piggy-
back on the reputation of the sending domain, which would negatively impact the reputation of 
the sending domain. In the case of Cosmic Lynx, their entire existence in the BEC space relies 
on emails landing in the inboxes of users, and if their delivery domains have poor Senderbase 
Reputation Scores (SBRS), most security appliances will refuse or flag these emails as being 
suspicious.

Cosmic Lynx DMARC policies.

This is a key differentiator when comparing traditional BEC actors and Cosmic Lynx, as true 
understanding of how email flow and editing DNS records is a skill that far exceeds traditional 
BEC actors.

Fortifying Infrastructure with Bulletproof Hosting
In order to make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in WHOIS records, 
Cosmic Lynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and 
anonymous domain provider. Based on a review of other domains registered with NiceVPS, it is 
clear that the service caters to cybercriminals. 

Instead of using basic Whois privacy when registering a domain, NiceVPS registers a domain 
on their customers’ behalf with their anonymous domain name service, adding an additional 
layer of anonymity between the domain and Cosmic Lynx. Instead of showing masked 
registrant details, a domain’s Whois record will just show contact details for NiceVPS, under the 
organization name “Nice IT Services Group Inc.” NiceVPS also does not require registrants to 
provide any personal information when registering a domain and purchases can be made using 
bitcoin, making it even harder to track someone’s identity.

NiceVPS warrant canary message. 

To make the infrastructure more friendly for scammers, NiceVPS makes use of a warrant canary, 
which will let users know if information has been subpoenaed or requested by law enforcement. 
If the warrant canary is not updated after a pre-determined period of time, this will tip the users 
of the infrastructure off that law enforcement intervention may be happening, giving attackers 
time to react and clean up their tracks.

Trickbot, Emotet, and BEC...Oh My!
One of the more notable aspects of Cosmic Lynx’s BEC infrastructure is its links to other types 
of malicious activity, particularly malware infrastructure. Because Cosmic Lynx controls their 
infrastructure so closely, this may indicate deeper connections to the criminal underground that 
have not been observed by previous BEC actors. 

Between December 2019 and April 2020, two of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, vmc[.]fortinet-
protection[.]cc and cx[.]fortinet-gateway[.]cc, were hosted on IP address 46[.]249[.]62[.]202. 
This time frame overlaps with two other domains, adsclubpartners[.]ru and 00xff[.]net, hosted 
at this IP address that were used to host configuration files for Russian click fraud malware 
targeting Android mobile devices. 

Between December 2019 and January 2020, one of Cosmix Lynx’s mail servers, vs[.]secure-mx-
gateway[.]cc, was hosted on IP address 93[.]158[.]208[.]104. In October 2019, two months prior 
to Cosmic Lynx infrastructure pointed to the IP address, a sample of Trickbot, one of today’s 
most active banking Trojans, was seen making SSL connections to this IP address, indicating 
this address may have been used as a command and control (C2) server.

net[.]com, was hosted on IP 139[.]162[.]120[.]155. Between October and December 2019, 
multiple malicious word documents linked to the Emotet banking Trojan were observed being 
downloaded from the IP address. 

Between January 2020 and February 2020, one of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, vs[.]mx-
gateway-host[.]cc resolved to IP address 46[.]249[.]59[.]67. Around June 2019, this IP address 
was hosting Azorult malware, which is capable of stealing chat messages, browser history, 
and financial information. Between March 2019 and October 2019, this IP address also hosted 
mrgreen[.]ws, a carding marketplace that has been in operation since 2014.

Malware authors and other cybercriminals frequently cycle through infrastructure and in some 
cases, infrastructure is used for a single attack or campaign, so we cannot link Cosmic Lynx 
actors to these other malicious activities directly. Associations to infrastructure connected 
to more sophisticated malicious activity across multiple service providers is notable, though, 
because we generally do not see these types of links with other BEC groups.

Historically, a vast majority of BEC attacks have originated from actors in Nigeria. Looking 
at Cosmic Lynx’s attacks, though, it is clear they are a different breed than other active 
cybercriminal groups conducting BEC operations. Our assessment finds that Cosmic Lynx is 
likely composed of Russia-based actors, based on analysis of their attacks and infrastructure. 

The first piece of evidence that ties back to a Russian nexus is the time/date stamp in the 
email headers of some of the Cosmic Lynx attacks. Generally, the Date field in an email header 
reflects the time and date an email was sent and usually includes a UTC offset. While this UTC 
offset can be modified by either the sender or routing infrastructure, in many cases this offset 
will reflect the time zone of the sender. For many of the Cosmic Lynx attacks we have analyzed, 
the UTC offset in the email headers are set to +0300 (MSK), which corresponds to Moscow 
Standard Time. Moscow Standard Time is only observed in the eastern parts of Russia, as well 
as Belarus and very small parts of Georgia and Ukraine. Since none of the routing infrastructure 
used by Cosmic Lynx or their targets are located in Russia, and it is unlikely an actor would 
spoof an MSK offset, we assess that this is the likely time zone of the sender(s) of these 
messages.

As we discussed earlier, some of the infrastructure used by Cosmic Lynx to send BEC emails 
overlaps with infrastructure used by Trickbot and Emotet malware, which is believed to be tied 
to Russian actors. In addition to these potential connections, we have also observed multiple 
instances where IP addresses linked to Cosmic Lynx’s BEC domain have overlapped with 
infrastructure used to host Russian fake document websites. These sites, which seem to be 
catering to individuals in Russia and Ukraine, sell a variety of false Russian-language documents, 
such as diplomas, birth certificates, and death certificates.

The final piece of evidence pointing to Russian attribution comes from the metadata of 
documents sent by Cosmic Lynx in some of their BEC attacks. During one of our engagements 
with Cosmic Lynx, they sent us a document containing wire transfer instructions for a payment, 
as well as a fake non-disclosure agreement. A review of the metadata of these documents 
shows they were last saved by user “Serge Devant” prior to being sent to us. Serge Devant 
is the name of a DJ from Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the name of this user can be easily 
changed to reflect any name, using the name of a Russian DJ, regardless of whether it is 
legitimate or not, is notable. It should be noted that we have no evidence that the real Serge 
Devant is associated with Cosmic Lynx activity.

While none of these pieces of evidence on their own would warrant a solid attribution case, we 
believe looking at the totality of evidence together builds a strong circumstantial argument that 
some, if not all, Cosmic Lynx actors are based in Russia.

Conclusion
Business email compromise has become the predominant cyber 
threat businesses face today. Since 2016, businesses have lost at least 
$26 billion as a result of BEC attacks and, based on the most recent 
FBI IC3 report, losses from BEC attacks grew another 37 percent in 
2019, accounting for 40 percent of all cybercrime losses over the 
course of the year. Evidence that more sophisticated threat groups 
are adding BEC to their attack repertoire should concern everyone. 
Unlike traditional BEC groups, Cosmic Lynx has demonstrated the 
capability to develop much more complex and creative attacks 
that sets them apart from other more generic BEC attacks we see 
everyday. 

To protect against threats like these, organizations first need to 
understand and accept the state of today’s cyber threat landscape. 
Most email-based threats today, like BEC attacks, are very simple 
social engineering attacks that are technically unsophisticated. To 
effectively protect against these threats, companies need to make 
sure they have defenses in place that are equipped to detect identity 
deception attacks that traditional inbound filters are not accustomed 
to handling. Additionally, organizations should have good internal 
processes in place, so payment requests, regardless of source, are 
verified before they are processed.
