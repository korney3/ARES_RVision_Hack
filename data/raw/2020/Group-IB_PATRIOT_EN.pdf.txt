Introduction
the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, for which no country 
was prepared, has laid bare a number of problems in today’s soci-
ety. Both developing and developed countries have suffered and 
continue to suffer enormous losses. the world’s industries have 
been desperately trying to survive and are searching for new 
strategies to ensure global stability. Analysts estimate that, over 
the next two years, the coronavirus pandemic will strip the world 
economy of some $5.5 trillion1.  People are losing their health, their 
lives, their loved ones, their jobs, their businesses… the situation 
is becoming a global disaster whose consequences will be felt for 
decades to come. to make matters worse, this is when cybercrime 
rears its ugly head.

For more than 17 years, Group-IB has been researching the tactics, 
tools, and monetization schemes used by various cybercriminal 
groups and individuals whose overall damage to governments 
worldwide amounts to billions of dollars. We are acutely aware 
of the cyclic nature of this phenomenon. For cybercriminals, any 
crisis is a time of prosperity. While for most people financial insta-
bility casts aside anything other than survival, criminals raise their 
profits by taking vast sums of money out of people’s pockets and 
economies. one shadow economy channel is online piracy.

the fight against this disease within the media industry has been 
ongoing for some 20 years, but it is only recently that the scale 
of the piracy business has escalated to such a colossal extent. 
russian-speaking cybercriminal conglomerates are no longer con-
tent with income that comes solely from video content consum-
ers in russia and other post-soviet countries. they have started 
branching out into international markets, mainly in developing 
countries. this gives them opportunities to increase the capitaliza-
tion of their shadow businesses manifold. 

the us media industry — the largest in the world — is also suffer-
ing losses because of piracy. the Global Innovation Policy Center 
of the us Chamber of Commerce estimates that online piracy 
costs the us economy up to $29.2 billion2. 

It has become obvious that pirate resources3 have adapted 
to pressure from copyright holders. Pirate infrastructures are 
resilient to new technologies and certain legal initiatives. Pirates’ 
main investors are still illegal bookmakers, casinos, and alcohol 
suppliers, or in other words: the entire black market, which spon-
sors camrip groups4,  translators, and It infrastructures for pirated 
content.

since 2015, Group-IB has been annually 
estimating the size of the russian video 
piracy market. 

The figures are as follows:

2015: $32 million
2016: $62 million
2017: $85 million
2018: $87 million

After major pirated content delivery 
networks	(CDNs)	Moonwalk	and	HDGO	
were shut down in 2019, the market 
dropped to $63.5 million. It is now 
rising again, however, due to a second 
wave of	CDNs.

the shadow economy is not alone to facilitate piracy, however. 
the industry has capacities to host and stream videos that are 
often bought by pirate platforms from legal hosting services with 
impunity. Pirate websites embed video players belonging to one 
or several CDns and monetize the content by showing ads. users 
can freely visit pirate websites, mainly through search engines 
or social media. Meanwhile, pirates have been making themselves 
increasingly richer by using processing services of banks, which 
inadvertently act as accomplices.

eliminating a single component of the pirate Hydra will not kill it. 
It will simply regenerate. the war on it must be waged on all fronts. 
this is the only way to cure cyberspace, develop immunity to piracy, 
not just in russia but in international markets too, and stop its out-
breaks as soon as possible.

Executive Summary

the purpose of this report is to deliver a devastating blow to cyber-
crime: to expose the entire structure of online piracy, to uncover 
the key organizations that sponsor this activity and those behind 
them.

Group-IB’s report contains confidential data, including informa-
tion on individuals believed to be behind some of the key piracy 
industry players. Copies of this report have been provided to the 
russian Prosecutor General’s office, russian and international law 
enforcement agencies.

As an international company, Group-IB is calling on the media 
industry, on regulating authorities, and on international organiza-
tions interested in fighting cybercrime to work together and help 
dismantle a business that has been developing for years, draining 
blood and cancelling the efforts of copyright holders worldwide.

Shadow investors in online piracy. As part of their anti-piracy and 
brand protection activities, Group-IB specialists used the follow-
the-money approach to identify who profited from unlawful activity. 
they found that illegal casinos and bookmaker companies were 
the main beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming ser-
vices and pirated sports streaming services. the leaders of the 
illegal casino market are Welcome Partners and Lucky Partners.

Taking advantage of geopolitical tensions. those behind one 
of the most popular CDns, Collaps, which provides content to 45% 
of pirate websites primarily watched by the russians, are based 
in ukraine which allows them to continue unlawful activity. 

Use of Russian banks and international payment systems in crim-
inal schemes. Despite most of their owners residing in ukraine, 
popular online casinos have been using russian banks to receive 
payments as part of their monetization schemes. none of the 
banks classify this type of activity as MCC5 7995.

Symbiosis of gambling and pirated online traffic. next to films and 
tV series, sports streaming is becoming a new source of reve-
nue for pirates. the main advertisers in this case are quasi-legal 
bookmakers: 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch, Linebet, orca88, Bwin, and 
others. A streaming service’s average revenue is between 20% 
and 40% of the sum lost by the gamblers it attracted (depending 
on	the	partner	program).	Well-developed	partner	programs	help	
bookmakers make more than $21,000 per month (for a website 
with	an	average	of	70-80	gamblers	attracted	daily).

Russian-speaking cybercrime in international markets. After 
being blocked in russia, shadow bookmakers shifted their focus to:

• Latin	America	(mainly	Brazil);
• India;
• thailand.

Having polished their schemes in russia (which has traditionally 
been	used	as	a	testing	ground	for	cybercrime),	they	started	enter-
ing markets with similar characteristics: developing countries, 
non-english speaking regions, populations with low financial liter-
acy, and countries where sports streaming is highly popular.

this situation resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and 
pirated content. since 2015, 1xBet has allegedly sponsored con-
tent for 17 tV show voiceover studios (i.e. 80% of major voiceover 
studios).	1xBet	is	one	of	the	main	sponsors	of	illegal	distribution	
of tV series in the post-soviet region. What’s more, in 2018 1xBet 
started creating content for other countries:

total releases:  over 500.

total titles covered: over 270.

Distribution by language:

• 100%6	of	camrips	are	in	English;
• 14%	of	camrips	are	in	Spanish;
•  5% of camrips are in other languages (tamil (predominantly 

spoken	in	India’s	South),	Portuguese,	Thai,	Hindi,	and	others).

Evasion of technical blocking and lawful prosecution. Content 
delivery	networks	(CDNs)	play	a	key	role	in	online	piracy.	They	are	
services that aggregate pirated content and optimize its delivery 
to the customer. they supply up to 80% of illegal video streaming 
services in russia and other post-soviet countries.

The characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:

• frequent	changes	of	technical	domains	and	IP	pools;
• use	of	geographically	distributed	infrastructures;
•  duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are  

usually rented from various Internet service providers.

these measures have made the currently enforced practices stip-
ulated in anti-piracy legislation ineffective.

Exploitation of legal hosting services’ capacities. Group-IB stud-
ied the activities of several pirate groups. Analyses of their techni-
cal infrastructures revealed that they systematically used capaci-
ties belonging to russian companies.

23%
of 3,100 pirate resources analyzed 
during the pandemic posed risks 
to users

76.8 mln
is the amount of total visits 
to dangerous resources in March

Having analyzed the number of CDns utilizing Mnogobyte’s infra-
structure, we determined that the company Mnogobyte is likely 
to be one of the leaders in providing hosting services for pirate 
CDns.7 A copyright holder’s complaint about pirate services being 
hosted by a hosting service will yield no results because unique 
links created for each user individually cannot be opened by any-
one else. this means that a hosting service whose servers are 
used by pirate CDns has all formal grounds to remove themselves 
from handling the matter, absolve themselves from any responsibil-
ity, and continue to make money by providing a platform for pirate 
businesses.

In addition, analyses revealed a number of network addresses 
that serviced pirate websites and officially belonged to a company 
called DDos-GuArD. the company regularly ensures the opera-
tion of services that engage in unlawful activity, thereby essentially 
providing tools for committing offences.

Infection of pirated content with malware. the growing number 
of online users goes hand in hand with increased fraud and more 
criminal groups that operate online. Because of how popular they 
are,	pirate	websites	(streaming	services,	torrent	trackers,	etc.)	act	
as platforms for distributing malware and stealing users’ money 
and personal data. During the pandemic, Group-IB checked over 
3,100 pirated content websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and 
inclusion in blacklists compiled by antivirus providers and search 
engines. the analysis revealed that up to 23% of pirate resources 
posed risks to users. In March, the number of total visits to danger-
ous resources amounted to 76.8 million. Most of these resources 
were in the .ru domain.

7    the main outcomes of this analysis are provided in the Infrastructure of pirate CDns chapter. 
All the details can be provided at the formal request of competent authorities.

Introduction 
to video piracy
the current situation on the online piracy market is developing 
against the background of the actively enforced anti-piracy law 
and cooperation between copyright holders and popular search 
engines.

In addition, the closure of major first-wave pirate CDn services 
had a significant impact on the market. After Group-IB’s report 
was released, in october 2019 the anti-piracy groups BreIn, ACe, 
and MPA took down Moonwalk, the most popular CDn service 
at the time. Acting on behalf of these groups, law enforcement 
officers disabled the servers — which ensured Moonwalk’s opera-
tion — belonging to three Dutch hosting services and two overseas 
companies whose servers were physically located in the neth-
erlands. the shutdown of Moonwalk led to the closure of a major 
CDn HDGo, with another provider, Kodik, losing a significant part 
of its content. Both used the same infrastructure as Moonwalk.

under such conditions, the behavior of pirate website administra-
tors is characterized by a desire to eliminate risks by:

CDN service 
Moonwalk
was blocked by the anti-piracy  groups 
BreIn, ACe and MPA in october 2019 
after Group-IB`s report was released  

Many pirate websites use several CDns at once in case one 
of them fails. In addition, CDn aggregators such as yohoho, 
emblix, uitools, and others are becoming increasingly popular. 
Aggregators track content on all major CDns and provide their 
own video players, which makes it possible to switch CDns 
at the user’s discretion.

the shift in focus to russian Internet service providers 
is	connected	to	three	factors:	(i)	the	seizure	of	the	Dutch	
servers	that	hosted	Moonwalk,	HDGO,	and	Kodik;	(ii)	the	
availability	of	russian	services;	and	(iii)	the	lack	of	successful	
and tangible legal action against russian Internet service 
providers that offer their capacities to pirate websites.

Diversifying content sources

Pirates used to put most of their efforts into developing 
a small number of websites operated simultaneously. Due 
to search engine results being actively blocked and cleared, 
however, this tactic is being used less and less often, mainly 
by blocked major websites whose owners rely on their audi-
ences’ loyalty despite the need to use blocking evasion tools. 
other webmasters prefer attracting traffic by creating many 
identical sites. this way, losing one site will not result in any 
significant negative consequences.

Shifting from quality to quantity

Pirate website administrators who are constantly forced 
to create new websites due to blocking have a myriad of mod-
ules and scripts that help them quickly transfer and recover 
databases. to sync pirate databases, they use film IDs 
of major specialized portals such as Kinopoisk and IMDB.

Increasing the share of new CDNs 
that use Russian infrastructure

The current structure of the pirated video market comprises:

1.  specialized advertising networks (bookmakers, casinos, 
alcohol,	etc.)	that	sponsor	camrip	groups,	translators,	CDNs,	
and pirate websites.

2. 	CDNs	that	offer	their	capacities	for	video	hosting	and	
streaming. In turn, these capacities are purchased by pirate 
platforms from legal hosting services. 

3.  Pirate websites that embed the players belonging to one 
or more CDns and monetize content by displaying ads to users.

4.  users who visit pirate websites mainly through search engines 
and social media.

CDns play a key role in online piracy. these services aggregate 
pirated content, optimize its delivery to the end user, and help 
video streaming services make money through partner programs. 
CDns provide content to up to 80% of pirate video streaming ser-
vices in russia and other post-soviet countries.

CDns are not hosting services or communications service provid-
ers. Instead, they use server capacities provided by other (legiti-
mate)	Internet	service	providers.

the main problem that copyright holders face when interacting 
with CDns is that their complaints are ignored and their demands 
are met on paper only. In particular, many CDns create links for 
specific users or devices using tokens. Moreover, these links often 
function for a limited time only. Complaints about such links are 
ineffective because the links change regularly, while illegal content 
continues to be distributed. CDns take no measures against viola-
tors, thereby encouraging unlawful activity.

Legal hosting services whose servers are used by CDns usually 
refuse to handle the issue and evade responsibility by giving formal 
replies that given links are unavailable.

At the moment, the main CDNs are:

• Collaps
• HDVB
• VideoCDn
• Kodik
• Videoframe
• Bazon
• ustore
• Alloha
• Protonvideo

The specific characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:

• frequent	changes	of	technical	domains	and	IP	pools;
• use	of	geographically	distributed	infrastructures;
•  duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are usu-

ally rented from various providers.

A	number	of	the	largest	streaming	services	(e.g.	Hdrezka)	have	
their own servers designed to store and deliver video content. 
In most cases, however, these servers are not used by other 
resources since they do not involve partner programs and there-
fore bring no profit.

Threat 
of pirate 
websites

As they are highly popular, pirate sites (streaming services, tor-
rent	trackers,	etc.)	are	convenient	platforms	for	distributing	mal-
ware and stealing users’ money and personal data. these sites 
can be both sources of threats (if their administrators are threat 
actors)	and	targets	for	other	threat	actors.

During the pandemic, Group-IB screened over 3,100 pirated con-
tent websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and inclusion in blacklists 
compiled by antivirus software providers and search engines. 

The resources were divided into three risk categories:

Analysis revealed that up to 23% of pirate resources posed risks 
to users. Moreover, total visits to dangerous resources in March 
amounted to 76.8 million.

Visiting these websites did not entail  
any risks to users.

1. 

Safe websites

no threats were detected on these 
websites. However, analysis revealed 
various vulnerabilities that could poten-

such vulnerabilities are most often the 
result of outdated or hacked software 
(e.g. CMs8).

2.

Most pirate resources use outdated or hacked software as well 
as custom-made parts of code, all of which can contain vulnera-
bilities. the two main reasons for this are a desire to save on the 
costs of creating and operating a website and the fact that some 
administrators have poor technical skills.

the fact that most dangerous resources are in the .ru domain 
also supports this claim. experienced webmasters tend 
to use overseas domains, including offshore ones, to host their 
resources. registering a pirate resource in the .ru domain is easier 
for beginners, although it does involve legal risks. At the same time, 
these webmasters do not always have the necessary technical 
knowledge and tools to ensure that their resources are safe.

Infrastructure 
of pirate CDNs

Collaps
Collaps is one of the most popular CDns. We believe that its orga-
nizers are from ukraine. they are also the creators of two large 
pirate streaming services, Baskino and Hdrezka. As at late 2019, 
45% of pirate streaming services used this CDn.9

the main domain is collaps.org. Video players are placed on third-
level technical domains, with formats including *.delivembed.
cc, *.multikland.net, *.ellinagraypel.com, *. iframecdn.club, and 
*.apicollaps.

At the moment, access to many of them is restricted. to bypass 
blocking, the service promptly generates new technical domains 
and regularly changes its IP pool. new domains are created 
according to the template api*.(multikland.net|delivembed.cc|elli-
nagraypel.com)	and	using	the	function	JavaScript	Date.Now().

the content is distributed using technical domains with the for-
mats *.s2w3.space, *.pixars.org, and *.embedcdn.cc. the links were 
found between the CDn Collaps and the pirate streaming services 
Baskino and Hdrezka.

This assumption is based on the following facts:

1.  the domains collaps.org and baskino.club used to have the 
same	Google	Analytics	ID	(UA-131285663).	At	the	moment,	this	
ID is used by more than 50 pirate websites, including bzserial.
online, hd-kino.info, kino-tyr.ru, kinogram.life, and anilive.su.

2.  the current domain http://baskino.me has only Collaps and 
Hdrezka video players embedded.

3. 	A	person,	whose	personal	details	match	those	of	the	official	
representative of the Baskino website on VKontakte, a social 
networking	site	(https://vk.com/baskino),	is	mentioned	as	the	
registrar for numerous Hdrezka mirror websites (e.g. hdrez-
ka-ag.com, mrhdrezka.com, betahdrezka.com, myhdrezka.com, 
newhdrezka.com, aghdrezka.com, wehdrezka.com, nuhdrezka.
com,	instahdrezka.com).	

9    Hereinafter, the share of pirate websites using a particular CDn is shown in relation to the  
total number of pirate websites analyzed. one site can use multiple CDns at once.

HDVB
HDVB is the second most popular CDn. As at late 2019, 38% 
of pirate streaming services used this CDn.

Video traffic comes from regularly updated domains: *tesswalton.
pw, *bernardjordan.pw, *elmerwatson.pw, *alfredcurry.pw, *quinn-
nash.pw, *frankfoley.pw, *rexhammond.pw, *janenoble.pw, *nadia-
pattel.pw, etc. the domains are generated mainly in the .pw domain 
zone according to the template vb{some_number}{random_name_
surname}.pw. It also hosts video players.

the CDn’s domains are regularly blocked by roskomnadzor 
(russia’s Federal service for supervision of Communications, 
Information	Technology	and	Mass	Media)	in	accordance	with	the	
procedure established in Article 15.2 of russian Federal Law no. 
149-FZ of July 27, 2006 “on Information, Information technologies, 
and Protection of Information,” which leads to new ones being cre-
ated constantly. the domains are changed using a script published 
on	GitHub	(https://partnercoll.github.io/actualize.js).

The economics 
of illegal resources
As part of their anti-piracy and brand protection activities, 
Group-IB specialists used the follow-the-money approach to identify 
who profited from unlawful activities.

It was found that illegal casinos and bookmakers were the main 
beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming services and pirated 
sports video streaming services.

Although other monetization methods exist, online casino and book-
maker partner programs are still the main way to generate income 
in the piracy business.

Pirate websites act as advertising platforms designed to attract new 
users. In most gambling partner programs, compensation is a per-
centage of the sum lost by online players.

For the largest partners, other terms can be established accord-
ing	to	the	CPA	(cost	per	action)	model.	In	this	case,	compensation	
is paid for an agreed list of player actions and does not depend on the 
sum lost.

There are usually three kinds of advertising materials:

• partner	links;
• promo	codes;
• banners.

Partner links and banners are most often used on websites, while 
broadcasts and videos contain promo codes and ads of their own 
domains.

to keep statistics and track visits, links and banners have unique 
IDs	(referral	codes)	that	help	identify	what	website	a	user	has	come	
from. If advertising is embedded into streamed video content, promo 
codes are used for the same purpose. to ensure that promo codes 
are used during registration, players are offered a small bonus, often 
paid by the organizer of the pirate video broadcast (the bonus is later 
subtracted from the final compensation for the online player the orga-
nizer	attracted).

the bonuses mean that it is more profitable for players to register 
using referral links or promo codes. Active players, let alone those 
addicted to gambling, can have multiple accounts to diversify risks 
related to money withdrawal and account blocking.

the main advertisers in sports streaming are 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch, 
Linebet, orca88, Bwin, and others. A streaming service’s average 
revenue is between 20% and 40% of the sum lost by the players 
it	attracted	(depending	on	the	partner	program).

As compensation is dependent on how lucky the online players are, 
it is impossible to forecast the revenue for each project. Moreover, 
passive income from previously attracted players grows over time.

As part of the Melbet partner program, beginners make $140 in their 
first month on average (for resources with over 7,000 subscribers 
and	more	than	14,000	views	per	day).

Customers who take part in the Melbet program for a long time can 
reach revenues of up to $21,000 per month (for resources with 
an	average	of	70-80	players	attracted	daily).

Statistics:10

example of revenue from the partner program forum*

Although some partner program participants have high profits, 
it should be noted that online casinos and bookmakers often use 
schemes to reduce commission sums. For example, regular pay-
ments may be delayed or cancelled altogether under various pre-
texts. traffic and the number of players attracted may be underre-
ported, as may sums lost by the players. statistics may be mixed 
with fake data simulating frequently winning players. What’s more, 
nearly all bookmakers cut the account balances for players who 
have considerable profits in the long run. As a result, accounts 
belonging to partner program participants may even fall below zero.

10  the statistics were provided by participants of the Melbet partner program. this may have 
been done for advertising purposes and the information might not be factual or accurate.

General information
A perfect example of actively promoting a gambling brand online 
is the history of 1xBet.

1xBet is a betting company founded in 2006. Mediascope, spe-
cialized in media research, estimates that in Q1 2019 1xBet came 
third in the top 10 list of advertisers in the online videos segment, 
with	2.4%	(by	comparison,	Google	topped	the	list	and	had	3.3%).	
According to the year-end results of 2019, however, the company 
did not make it to the list due to active measures against online 
gambling. At the moment, various experts estimate that the com-
pany is not even on the list of the top 30 advertisers in russia.

the bookmaker’s primary audience includes residents of develop-
ing	countries	(India,	Brazil,	Thailand,	and	post-Soviet	countries).

In 2009, russia passed a law that banned non-certified gambling 
organizations. two years later, the russian government had claims 
against 1xBet for the first time. In 2016, access to the main domain 
1xBet.com was restricted in russia.

To prevent losses, 1xBet took two steps:

1. It expanded its development beyond the post-soviet region.
2.  It took measures to bypass blocking: numerous mirror sites 

(over	800)	were	created	and	an	ad	system	involving	pirate	
traffic	(voiceover	studios,	camrip	groups)	was	developed.

Entry into the markets of developing countries
After being blocked in russia, 1xBet owners shifted their focus to:

• Latin	America	(primarily	Brazil);
• India;
• thailand.

Like Russia, these regions and countries have the following 
characteristics:

1. they are developing countries.
2. their inhabitants are mainly non-english speakers.
3. Their	populations	have	a	low	financial	literacy.
4. sports streaming is highly popular.

Links with piracy in the post-Soviet region
official advertising services rarely work together with pirate por-
tals. In their license agreements, major aggregators such as yan-
dex and Google have paragraphs that ban the use of content 
without the copyright holder’s consent.

this resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and pirate 
traffic.

In september 2015, 1xBet, together with the voiceover studio 
Baibako team, published their first ever joint release, with their ads 
integrated into the video.

First time that 1xBet work together with with pirates voiceover studio

Based on the analysis of conversations on specialized forums, 
since 2015, 1xBet is likely to have sponsored  content for 17 tV show 
voiceover	studios	(i.e.	80%	of	major	voiceover	studios).

1xBet has been one of the main sponsors of illegal distribution 
of tV series in the post-soviet region since 2017.

Collaboration with voiceover studios was based on the follow-
ing pattern: a voiceover studio would inform an 1xBet advertising 
manager about a possibility to produce content and 1xBet would 
pay for it. this meant that 1xBet did not participate in content pro-
duction	(did	not	order	any	specific	content)	but	sponsored	it.	Its	
collaboration with camrip groups was similar.

Voiceover studies and their representatives searched for digital 
copies of content released abroad. the more relevant the content, 
the more 1xBet paid for it.

the average cost of voiceover services for one episode amounted 
to about $55.11  For a movie already released online, the cost was 
$65-$70. 1xBet spent between $5,000 and $8,300 on average 
per month on sponsoring voiceover studios and creating camrips 
in the post-soviet region.

If	we	look	at	the	history	of	camrips,	the	average	cost	of	produсing	
one camrip amounted to between $400 and $1,000 (depending 
on	the	copy’s	quality	and	the	content’s	popularity).

As for integrating ads into the pre-rolls of pirate CDns, collabora-
tion has been ongoing since 2016. As such, 1xBet ads have been 
placed on more than 80% of all pirate resources in post-soviet 
countries.

the total number of content items voiced over with 1xBet’s sup-
port in post-soviet countries amounts to over 900 (movies and 
Tv	series).

Beginning of interaction with Koshara/Octopus team
In February 2019, the group Koshara started acting 
as an intermediary between 1xBet and voiceover studios. Around 
the same time, this release-group began creating camrips with 
hardcoded 1xBet ads for post-soviet countries.

Koshara still makes its own camrips regardless of 1xBet, which 
is	why	1xBet	ads	often	appear	several	times	in	different	versions	
of	a	camrip.	The	first	time	is	when	a	voiceover	studio	edits	
an	overseas	camrip;	the	second	time	is	when	a	camrip	is	created	
locally.

In addition to producing content, Koshara commits to distributing 
content by placing it on more than eight major torrent tracker 
services	(including	its	own	website)	and	uploading	it	to	two	CDNs	
after the content is released.

since 1xBet started working with Koshara, over 100 camrips have 
been released, which amounts to an average of three per week.

General information
For a long time, the two partner programs Lucky Partners and Wel-
come Partners were the main participants involved in the under-
ground online casino market.

According to media reports, Lucky Partners was founded by rus-
tam Gilfanov. His partner was sergey tokarev.12 In 2011, Lucky 
Partnerns moved from Moscow to Kiev due to ukraine’s less strict 
gambling laws.13

Welcome Partners was founded by a ukrainian entrepreneur, 
the owner of many ukrainian online casinos and popular dating 
websites.

Lucky Partners started collaborating with the Welcome Partners 
leadership in 2013. However, they later had a conflict, which has 
been ongoing for over six years.

Business practices
Both partner programs use two types of illegal online casinos: 
licensed and non-licensed.

In several countries, including in europe, laws generally allow for 
online casinos to operate. As such, some developers provide 
software for online casinos that comply with gambling regula-
tions. In such casinos, winning is possible and winnings are based 
on a mathematical algorithm that ensures that the casino always 
has some profit. these casinos are considered licensed.

In the case of non-licensed casinos, similar software is installed, 
but it is cracked and allows setting arbitrary betting odds, including 
in a way that makes winning impossible.

It is worth mentioning that Lucky Partners try to distance them-
selves from the most well-known casinos, particularly Azino777, but 
media outlets have confirmed that this casino is in fact one of their 
projects.

Along with online casinos, partner programs are involved in other 
gambling-type projects: small Forex brokers and binary options 
(a business that deals with bets on currencies and cryptocurren-
cies, which in general is banned by international payment systems, 
russian	law,	and	the	laws	of	European	countries),	various	lotteries,	
and other similar products.

Lucky Partners and Welcome Partners stay away from Fonbet and 
1xBet, the leaders of the bookmaker industry. nevertheless, both 
support the gambling industry.

Accepting payments
International payment systems require that almost all 
aforementioned types of businesses be registered with a special 
transaction code, MCC 7995. this is the code that was blocked 
in the us to stop online casino transactions. Violating the MCC 
7995	requirement	incurs	significant	fines	starting	at	$25,000	for	
each incident.

In addition, banks assign MCC codes based on data that 
companies themselves provide. to be able to operate in russia, 
online casinos specify other MCC codes. For example, Azino used 
the	code	6012	(sale	of	certificates	and	consulting	services	as	well	
as	loan	payments),	while	the	actual	recipient	was	the	company	
Victory 777 n.V, which held a Curaçao license.14 In December 
2018, the company was placed on the list of entities for which 
there is information that they organize and host gambling games 
in violation of russian law. this list is kept by the russian Federal 
tax service and includes 42 companies. It was last updated 
in August 2019.

to verify payment information, Group-IB specialists used the 
website	https://affgambler.ru/blacklisted-casinos,	which	lists	the	
most popular licensed and non-licensed online casinos.

15  the names of the banks have not been disclosed in the report’s public version for  
confidentiality	reasons.	This	information	has	been	provided	to	relevant	government	agencies.

Analysis suggests that all popular online casinos use exclusively 
russian banks15 to accept payments, despite the fact that the 
owners are based in ukraine. none of the banks use MCC 7995 
for this activity even though there are technical solutions that 
help automatically check websites connected to the processing 
system	for	illegal	content	(including	related	to	online	casinos).	

such actions by banks are ignored by the international payment 
systems Visa and Mastercard and the russian system Mir, which 
runs counter to both the rules of the payment systems themselves 
and the provisions of the Central Bank of russia. 

there are almost no international precedents of online casinos 
or bookmakers violating MCC 7995. under the rules of international 
payment systems, this type of violation is one of the most serious 
ones, second only to payments for child pornography.

$25,000+
is	a	fine	for	violating	the	 
MCC 7995 requirement

In russia, Visa and Mastercard parent organizations fail 
to address the ubiquitous violations. the reason could be their 
poor understanding of the scale of online piracy in russia and 
the monetization of this business through the gaming industry. 
As such, we have shared this report with the parent organizations 
of the payment systems.

Distributing payments
for	outgoing	financial	flows	(namely	players’	winnings	and	
commission	payouts	to	webmasters	for	ads),	acquiring	banks	
usually act as intermediaries. Payouts to webmasters seem 
to be carried out through the online bank capitalist.net.

Attracting advertising
Attracting	ad	traffic	to	the	aforementioned	projects	is	done	 
in two ways.

The	first	method	is	advertising	in	the	webmaster	community,	
which centers around the forums gofuckbiz.net, maultalk.com, and 
armadaboard.com.	Community	members	meet	at	various	offline	
events, mainly overseas to avoid the attention of law enforcers. 
According to the information available, these forums also belong 
to capitalist.net.

the second method involves ads through pirate websites 
using specialized advertising agencies. one of such agencies 
is	Adwise	Agency,	whose	links	with	Lucky	Labs	were	confirmed	
by the media.16 Adwise Agency has been suspected of having 
links with illegal online gambling and pirate websites (e.g. Kinogo, 
HDrezka,	filmix,	Kinoprofi),	including	by	law	enforcement	agencies.	
In February 2020, the Cyber Police of ukraine searched Adwise 
Agency’s	offices	in	relation	to	the	funding	of	the	pirate	websites	
kinosha.se,	kinanema.net,	kinoprofi.vip,	rezka.ag,	and	 
filmix.co.17

Russian infrastructure  
of illegal resources
ZeroCDn, which belongs to the russian company Mnogobyte, 
is one of the most popular services used for placing and distribut-
ing video content. As at late 2019, the ZeroCDn project infrastruc-
ture was used by 38% to 60% of pirate websites.

The following CDNs were found to use ZeroCDN servers:

•  VideoCDn (the third most popular CDn, used by up to 33% 
of	pirate	websites);

• Kodik;
• videoframe;
• Protonvideo.

In addition, ZeroCDn servers are used by some separate  
projects,	in	particular	Hdrezka	(over	52	million	visitors	per	month)	 
and	Kinogo	(more	than	35	million	visitors	per	month).

the company’s website mentions that the Mnogobyte network 
has direct connections to major russian communications ser-
vice providers, including Beeline, Mts, and transtelecom, as well 
as Moscow-based and regional operators. Major ukrainian com-
munications service providers (eurotel, Dataline, Datagroup, and 
Topnet)	and	Belarus’	largest	telecommunications	service	pro-
vider Beltelecom are also connected to the Mnogobyte network. 
What’s more, Mnogobyte is part of several Internet exchange 
Points	(MSK-IX,	DATA-IX,	W-IX,	Global-IX).

In 2015, the company launched the ZeroCDn project, the aim 
of which was to store and transfer large amounts of media content.

since 2017, the company has been officially working with the swiss 
solutions provider Digitalone AG.20

the russian company DDos-GuArD provides anti-DDos and con-
tent delivery services. It is also a hosting service provider.22

By order of the russian Ministry of Digital Development, Com-
munications and Mass Media no. 326-FZ of June 26, 2017, the 
DDos-Guard Protection software was registered as an information 
security tool in russia’s unified register of Programs for electronic 
Computers and Databases.

yet the company’s services are used by many illegal resources, 
including pirate and fraudulent ones. DDos-GuArD does not usu-
ally respond to any complaints regarding such resources.

The company DDOS-GUARD: 

• 	provides	fraudulent	websites	with	its	computing	capacities,	
which	are	used	to	operate	the	websites	in	question;

• 	conceals	the	actual	hosting	service	and	obstructs	the	identifi-
cation of website owners.

It is of note that the terms and conditions of using DDos-
GuArD’s services stipulate that customers agree to use the 
specified services for lawful purposes only. yet organizing gambling 
games and scams falls under unlawful use.23

Despite that, DDos-GuArD does not comply with its own 
terms and conditions of using their services. under Articles 
15.1 to 15.6-1 of russian Federal Law no. 149-FZ of July 27, 2006 
“on Information, Information technologies, and Protection 
of Information,” access to many websites that distribute ille-
gal information and that are or have been hosted on DDos-
GuArD’s network addresses is restricted by roskomnadzor (rus-
sia’s Federal service for supervision of Communications, Informa-
tion	Technology	and	Mass	Media).	At	the	same	time,	the	specified	
procedure before blocking provides for the mandatory notification 
of violation to the hosting provider, indicating the need to remove 
unlawful information. thus, DDos-GuArD knew about the viola-
tions on the blocked websites, but did not take any actions.

As at June 24, 2020, a total of 453 such resources (domains 
or URL addresses) were blocked. These include:

•  6 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork 
185.129.100.0/24;

•  5 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork 
185.129.102.0/24;

•  442 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork

Legal information
the activities of online casinos are regulated by russian Federal 
Law no. 244-FZ of December 29, 2006 “on the state regulation 
of Activities Involving the organization and Conduct of Gambling 
and on the Introduction of Amendments to Certain Legislative 
Acts of the russian Federation.”

requirements for gambling game organizers are laid down in Article 
6. For instance, only legal entities duly registered according to the 
established procedure within the territory of the russian Federa-
tion can organize gambling games. In turn, only legal entities that 
are part of a self-regulatory organization of gambling game orga-
nizers at bookmakers or a self-regulatory organization of gambling 
game organizers at betting houses can organize gambling games 
at bookmakers or betting houses.

Article 5 of this law sets out restrictions on organizing and con-
ducting gambling games, including a ban on such activity when 
it involves information and telecommunications networks, including 
the Internet, and also when it involves means of communication, 
including mobile communication (with the exception of instances 
of accepting interactive bets and payouts on them by organizers 
of	gambling	games	at	bookmakers	and	(or)	betting	houses).

Failure to comply with the above requirements incurs various types 
of liability.

Article 171.2 of the russian Criminal Code provides for criminal 
liability for natural persons who illegally organize and conduct gam-
bling games, including by using information and telecommunica-
tions networks, including the Internet, or means of communication.

under Article 14.1.1, paragraph 1, the same actions carried out 
by legal entities incur administrative liability and are punishable 
by	a	fine	between	800,000	rubles	($11,350)	and	1.5	million	rubles	
($21,300),	including	confiscation	of	the	gaming	equipment.

In addition, gambling websites may be subject to restriction 
of access within the territory of the russian Federation.

According to paragraph 1 of the regulation no. 228 of the 
Government of the russian Federation of March 16, 2009 “on the 
Federal service for supervision of Communications, Information 
technology, and Mass Media,” roskomnadzor is an executive body 
that supervises the media, mass communication, information 
technology, and communications.

As such, roskomnadzor takes measures to restrict access 
to websites that contain information whose distribution in russia 
is prohibited according to the procedure established in Article 
15.1 of russian Federal Law no. 149-FZ “on Information, Informa-
tion technologies, and Protection of Information.”

In particular, paragraph 5 of this Article allows for non-judicial 
restriction of access to information that violates russian Federal 
Law no. 244-FZ of December 29, 2006 “on the state regulation 
of Activities Involving the organization and Conduct of Gambling

Games and on the Introduction of Amendments to Certain Legis-
lative Acts of the russian Federation” and russian Federal Law  
no. 138-FZ of november 11, 2003 “on Lotteries,” which bans the 
organization and conduct of gambling games and lotteries that 
involve the Internet and other means of communication.

Pursuant	to	subparagraph	a)	of	paragraph	5	of	Decision-making	
rules for federal executive bodies authorized by the Government 
of the russian Federation in relation to certain types of informa-
tion and materials distributed through the Internet whose distribu-
tion in the russian Federation is prohibited (approved by russian 
Government Decree no. 1101 of october 26, 2012 “on the uniform 
Automated Information system the unified register of Domain 
Names	and	Website	references	on	the	Internet),	the	basis	for	
including domain names and website references related to gam-
bling in the unified register of prohibited information is a decision 
of the russian Federal tax service.

the information and material assessment criteria necessary for 
making such a decision are approved by order no. 84/292/351/
MMV-7-2/461s of May 18, 2017 by roskomnadzor, russian Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, the Federal service for surveillance on Con-
sumer	rights	Protection	and	Human	Wellbeing	(rospotrebnadzor),	
and the russian Federal tax service.

These criteria are:

1.  the existence of photo, video, audio and/or textual and graphic 
information encouraging to take part in a gambling game or lot-
tery that is conducive to attracting the attention of a poten-
tial participant on a website where it is possible to take part 
in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and receive payouts 
for winning.

2.  the existence of photo, video, audio and/or textual and graphic 
information that provides an understanding of a gambling game 
or	lottery;	terms	and	conditions	for	taking	part	in	a	gambling	
game or lottery, including rules of conducting gambling games 
and	terms	and	conditions	for	participating	in	lotteries;	poten-
tial	prizes;	description	of	ways	of	transferring	money	to	par-
ticipate	in	a	gambling	game	or	lottery;	and	ways	of	receiving	
prizes on a given website where it is possible to take part 
in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and receive payouts 
for winning.

3.  the existence of a demonstration of taking part in a gam-
bling game or lottery, with descriptions of the process and 
sequence of actions in a gambling game or lottery involving 
photo, video, audio, or images on a website where it is pos-
sible to take part in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and 
receive payouts for winning.

4.  the possibility of taking part in a gambling game or lottery 
on a website.

5.  the possibility of transferring money (including electronic 
money)	using	electronic	means	of	payment	to	participate	
in a gambling game or lottery, as well as a possibility of receiving 
(providing)	a	prize	on	a	website.

6.  the existence of a notice or information about the possi-
bility of taking part in a gambling game or lottery using other 
domain	names	and	(or)	website	references	on	the	Internet	
on a website.

7. 	The	existence	of	information	and/or)	computer	programs	
on a website that make it possible to access a website or web-
site page that contains forbidden information that meets the 
criteria	specified	in	the	paragraphs	above.

8.  the possibility of loading computer programs on a website 
or website page that make it possible to take part in a gambling 
game or lottery.

under russian law, Internet services that provide servers to CDns 
are considered information intermediaries.

According	to	Article	1253.1(3)	of	the	russian	Civil	Code,	
an information intermediary that provides an opportunity to place 
materials	on	the	Internet	(e.g.	a	hosting	service)	does	not	
bear responsibility for breaches of intellectual rights occurring 
as a result of materials being placed by a third party or on the 
instruction thereof. However, the responsibility is abrogated only 
if the information intermediary meets the following conditions:

1.  they neither knew nor should have known that the use of the 
relevant result of intellectual activity or means of personaliza-
tion in such materials was unlawful.

2.  After receving a written complaint by the copyright holder 
about a breach of intellectual rights with reference to the 
website page and/or to the web address where such material 
was placed, they took timely measures, which were necessary 
and	sufficient,	to	end	the	breach	of	the	intellectual	rights.	A	list	
of	the	measures	deemed	necessary	and	sufficient,	and	the	
procedure for implementing them, may be established by law.

this means that, if an Internet service that provides pirate CDns 
with their server capacities refuses to cooperate with copyright 
holders or if the measures taken are insufficient for stopping pirate 
activities, the following is possible:

• Civil	liability	is	imposed	on	the	Internet	service	provider;
•  Administrative and criminal liability is imposed on those 

responsible;
•  Demands to protect intellectual property rights are set  

(unrelated	to	the	enforcement	of	civil	liability	penalties),	
including demands to delete information that violates exclusive 
rights or demands to restrict access to such information.

Within the framework of civil law relations, recovery of damages 
may be claimed from a party that has unlawfully used the result 
of	intellectual	activity	(Article	1252(1)(3)	of	the	russian	Civil	Code).	
Demands for compensation can also be made (Article 1301 of the 
russian	Civil	Code).

In addition, depending on the damages, such a party can incur 
administrative liability under Article 7.12 of the russian Code 
on Administrative offences or criminal liability under Article 
146 of the russian Criminal Code. these types of liability can 
be applied against the Chief executive officer of a company 
whose activity has caused damages as a result of the unlawful use 
of intellectual property.

As an example, in April 2018 the Ceo of HoMe-iPtV, yuri 
Moskachev, was sentenced to three years’ suspended imprison-
ment	for	an	offence	under	Article	146(3)(v)	and	(g)	of	the	russian	
Criminal Code. According to the case file, the accused transferred 
the signal of the tV Channel nostalgiya, for which the copyright 
holder was ntV Plus, using the tCP/IP protocol without an agree-
ment with the copyright holder. the court later ordered yuri 
Moskachev to pay ntV Plus $180,390.
