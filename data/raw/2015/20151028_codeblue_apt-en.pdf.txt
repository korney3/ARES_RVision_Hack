Methods Used to Spread Infection 

• Exploiting vulnerabilities (MS14-068 + 
MS14-058) 

• Investigating SYSVOL scripts 
• Password list-based attack 
• Exploiting Built-in Administrator 

password 
• Setting malware in file servers 
• Exploiting WPAD 
• Others 

Patterns of spreading infection 

22 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting Vulnerabilities (MS14-068 + MS14-058)  

23 

Domain 
Controller 

PC-A 

PC-B 

1. Escalate privilege (MS14-058) and 
dump user’s password with mimikatz 
 

2. Exploit MS14-068 vulnerability and 
gain Domain Admin privileges 

3. Upload mimikatz to DC and dump 
admin’s passwords 

4. Copy malware to PC-B 

5. Register a task in order to execute malware 

6. Malware executes 
according to the task 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Investigating SYSVOL Scripts 

24 

• In some cases, passwords are found in logon script, 
etc. 

Key Point 

Attacker’s 
Infrastructure 

C2 Server 

3. Search admin’s 
password 

PC-A PC-B 

6. Malware executes 
according to the task 

2. Download 

1. Download logon script, 
compress and archive 

Domain 
Controller 

5. Register a task in order 
to execute malware  

4. Copy malware to 
PC-B 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Password List-based Attack 

25 

PC-A PC-B 4. Register a task  

3. Copy malware  

1. Get user’s list of 
Domain Admins 

5. Execute 

Domain 
Controller 

2. Attempts logon 
with logon.exe 

• Attempts logon by using an approximately 10-30 line password 
list and the user’s list of Domain Admins 

• Uses a tool called logon.exe (self-built?)  

Key Point 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

• An effective measure when there is no way to 
exploit Domain environment 

• Need to hash passwords or dump passwords 

Key Point 

Exploiting Built-in Administrator Password 

26 

PC-A PC-B 

3. Copy malware  

1. Escalate privilege (UAC bypass) 
and dump user’s password 

5. Execute 
4. Register a task  

net use ¥¥PC-B¥IPC$ [password]  /u:Administrator 

2. Pass the hash or net use 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

• Effective when there is no other measure  

Key Point 

Setting Malware in File Servers 

27 

PC-A PC-B 

1. Replace the existing file 
with malware disguised with 
fake icons 

2. Execute 
malware in file 
servers 

File Server 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting WPAD 
 

— Turned on by default 
— Get automatic configuration script from either 

  URL specified by DHCP server, or 
  http://wpad/wpad.dat 

 
 

 

28 

WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery)  



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting WPAD (Step 1: NetBIOS Spoofing) 

29 

• Effective in an environment where WPAD is not 
configured 

• NetBIOS Spoofing 

Key Point 

PC-A PC-B 

2. Name query response 
   (I am WPAD) 

1. Broadcast: Name query NB WPAD 

wpad.exe 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting WPAD (Step 2: Fake WPAD Server) 

30 

PC-A PC-B 

4. Response 

wpad.exe 

function FindProxyForURL(url, host) { 
 
 if (myIpAddress() != “[PC-A addr]”) { 
  return ‘PROXY wpad:8888;DIRECT’; 
 } 
 return ‘DIRECT’; 
} 

wpad.dat (automatic configuration script) 

3. Request http://wpad/wpad.dat 



Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting WPAD (Step 3: Man in the Middle 
Proxy) 

31 

PC-A PC-B 

5. Embed iframe in attacker’s 
Web site wpad.exe 

6. Drive-by download

Summary: Methods of Spreading Infection 

Method AD Privilege Escalation Note 

MS14-068 Necessary 
Unnecessary / 
Necessary for 

password dump 

Risk exists when DC is 
unpatched 

SYSVOL Search Necessary Unnecessary 
Brute Force Attack 
(Password List 
Attack) 

Necessary Unnecessary Risk exists when the password is weak 

Abusing Built-in 
Administrator Unnecessary Necessary 

Presumes that the 
password is the same 

Exploiting File 
Servers Unnecessary Unnecessary 

Risk exists when the 
file is disguised to one 
that many users open 

Exploiting WPAD Unnecessary Unnecessary Situations are limited
