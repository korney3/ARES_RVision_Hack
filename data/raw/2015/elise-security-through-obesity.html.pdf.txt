ELISE: Security Through Obesity
23 December 2015

 

By Michael Yip

Executive Summary       
Taiwan has long been subjected to persistent targeting from espionage motivated threat actors. This blog presents our
analysis of one of the latest malware variants targeting individuals in Taiwan, which exhibits some interesting
characteristics that can be useful for detecting and defending against the threat – including the creation of an obese
file, weighing in at 500MB, as part of its execution.

 

Malware Analysis
The sample which caught our attention for this analysis is a PowerPoint slideshow file named台灣學⽣網路援交觀

察.pps (translation: “Observations on cyber compensated dating among Taiwanese students”). The sample was
submitted to VirusTotal on 3rd December 2015 from Taiwan and at the time was only detected by 3 out of 54 antivirus
vendors as malicious. An exploit for CVE-2014-4114 is also detected and tagged by VirusTotal.

 

Figure 1: The sample is a PowerPoint file with exploit for CVE-2014-4114 embedded.

 

The initial lure
The figures below show some of the slides from the slideshow. All the contents in the slideshow are written in
Traditional Chinese, which is typically used in provinces in Southern China such as Guangdong and Hong Kong, as
well as Taiwan. Since the topic of the slideshow relates explicitly to Taiwanese and the submission was from Taiwan,
we assess the attacker was likely targeting Taiwanese individuals.

 

 

Figure 2: The lure document is a Powerpoint (.pps) slideshow on “Observations into cyber compensated
dating (援交) among Taiwanese students”.

Given the use of a malicious document as the initial lure, the delivery method in this campaign is almost certainly
spear-phishing.

 

Exploitation
Once the slideshow file is opened, whilst the slides are displayed in full screen mode, the malware is dropped in the
background. Specifically, two files are dropped into the %TEMP% directory: hlwyss.jpg and hlwyss.inf.

By examining the file header (as shown in Figure 3) of hlwyss.jpg, we can see that the file is in fact a MS-DOS
executable:

Figure 3: File header of hlwyss.jpg shows it's an MS-DOS executable.

The hlwyss.inf is an INF file which specifies file system operations required to install the malware (as shown in
Figure 4). The use of an embedded INF file for malware installation is consistent with the Metasploit implantation of
CVE-2014-4114, better known as the ‘Sandworm’ vulnerability.

 

Figure 4: Contents of the hlwyss.inf which shows the renaming of hlwyss.jpg to hlwyss.dll and installation of
the RunOnce key for malware execution.

 

As indicated in the INF file, the installation script renames hlwyss.jpg to hlwyss.dll and sets up the malware
through the creation of two RunOnce keys to ensure the execution of the malicious DLL using rundll32.exe, with
the entry point Setting.

 

Installation and execution
On examining logs produced during execution by ProcessMonitor, we find that aside from following the instructions
outlined in the INF file, the malware proceeds to perform additional operations to complete its installation. In particular,
the malware replicates itself in the %AppData%\Roaming\Programs folder and names its cloned copy
‘Syncmgr.dll’ (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: As part of the installation, another DLL called Syncmgr.dll is also created.

To ensure persistence on future restarts a Run key is also installed, however, the Run key points to the newly created
Syncmgr.dll rather than the original hlwyss.dll.

https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx


 

 

Figure 6: Run and RunOnce keys installed to ensure malware execution on boot up.

 

Planting the malware in the user’s AppData\Roaming folder is also a sign that the attacker was likely to be targeting
corporate users as corporate users often possess roaming user profiles, a Windows feature that allows users to
access their customised Windows environment from different machines.

As Syncmgr.dll is the main malicious payload, we took a closer look at the file. The malware was compiled on 24 th
November 2015 and it is a 32-bit DLL. This shows that the sample is recent and indicates the threat actor is currently
active.

Examining the PE structure of Syncmgr.dll shows a hidden executable embedded as one of the resources:

Figure 7: Executable embedded in resource.

 

Once SyncManager.dll is executed, an iexplore.exe process is spawned:

Figure 8: A malicious iexplore.exe process spawned.

 

Unsurprisingly, the strings of the iexplore.exe process reveals that the malware has injected itself into the process.

Figure 9: Malware injected into iexplore.exe.

 

By visualising the ProcessMonitor logs in ProcDOT, we see that two more files are created by the malware:
WEB2013BW6.DAT and 60HGBC00.DAT.

https://digital-forensics.sans.org/media/poster_2014_find_evil.pdf
http://www.procdot.com/faqs.htm


Figure 10: Malware creates two addition .DAT files.

 

By comparing the code constructs between the embedded resource ASDASDASDASDSAD and WEB2013BW6.DAT, we
see that they contain the identical code, as shown below:

 

 

Figure 11: The embedded resource (left) and WEB2013BW6.DAT have similar code constructs.

 

However, WEB2013BW6.DAT is over 500MB in size which is significantly larger than ASDASDASDASDSAD which is only
51KB in size:

Figure 12: Dropped files in AppData\Roaming\Programs folder.

 

An examination into the PE structure of WEB2013BW6.DAT shows that a significant amount of junk characters are
appended to the foot of the file:

 

Figure 13: Padding towards the end of WEB2013BW6.DAT.

 

Based on its contents, the .DAT file is likely a component responsible for network communication. ProcMon logs also
show that only once the iexplore.exe process is spawned, that the .DAT file is loaded into the process. Our current
hypothesis is that this is component of the malware often triggers antivirus signatures, and its huge size is an effort by
the authors to evade detection.

 

Network communications
Once the malware is executed, a HTTP GET request is sent to showip[.]net in an attempt to find out the victim’s
external IP address.

 



Figure 14: HTTP GET request to showip[.]net.

 

After obtaining the IP address, the malware then sends out a HTTP GET request to one of three command & control
(C2) servers configured in the malware, such as ustar5.PassAs[.]us. The full HTTP headers are as shown in the
figure below:

 

Figure 15: Network traffic to ustar5.PassAs[.]us generated after the malware is executed.

 

There are two interesting aspects to the observed HTTP traffic. Firstly, the user-agent is hardcoded in the malware
and as shown in the above figures, the same user-agent is used in both GET requests. Secondly, the victim IP is
stored as the SHO value in the cookie field in the HTTP GET request to the C2 server. Both characteristics are useful
for detection the presence of this particular malware.

The malware is configured to use the following hosts for c2 servers:

 

Domain IP Last seen

ustar5.PassAs[.]us
203.124.14[.]241 03/12/2015

103.193.150[.]33 15/12/2015

dnt5b.myfw[.]us 127.0.0.1 15/12/2015

- 203.124.14[.]241 -

 

As the malware attempts to establish contact with each of the designated C2 server, the malware also logs the errors
in a .tmp log file stored in the %TEMP% directory:

 

Figure 16: Log file generated by the malware during execution logging failed attempts at establishing contact
with configured C2s.

 

Functionalities
By examining the code constructs in the malware, we found evidence of the following functions:

File upload – upload file to server

File download – download file to victim machine

Remote shell – spawn remote shell

File system reconnaissance – obtain file metadata data

Process enumeration – enumerate running processes

Some of these functionalities are visible in the ASCII strings from the embedded payload ASDASDASDASDSAD:

 



Figure 17: Strings from the malware show hints on the functionalities offered by the malware.

 

Association with LOTUS BLOSSOM
Our first step in attempting to tie activity to known campaigns is to look for any infrastructure overlaps between the
domains used and those used previously by known threat actors, however we were unable to identify any
infrastructure overlap in this case.

However, network infrastructure is not the only method for attribution. Other useful methods include common tools and
techniques used by threat actors, as well as any other behavioural patterns in the modus operandi associated with
specific threat actors.

In this case, we believe the sample analysed is associated with the ‘Lotus Blossom’ threat actor based on the
following characteristics which are also seen in other samples associated with the actor:

The use of Microsoft Office document with content in Traditional Chinese as initial lure and exploit;

The targeting of Taiwanese individuals (Taiwan is often the target of the Lotus Blossom group) ;

The malware is written in C++ (like most other malware used by the Lotus Blossom threat actor);
The mention of Loader.dll (a filename referenced in other Elise samples);
The use of dynamic DNS domains, including use of the same providers;

The fixed user-agent Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1 ) ;
Mutex string Global\{7BDACDEE-8BF6-4664-B946-D00FCFF1FFBA};
The format of the configuration for the C2 servers (e.g. Server1=%s) ; and;
The presence of a JSON-like string within the malware matching the following regular expression:  \
{\"r\":\"[0-9]{12}\",\"l\":\"[0-9]{12}\",\"u\":\"[0-9]{7}\",\"m\":\"[0-9]
{12}\"\}.

These relationships are displayed graphically in the Maltego graph below:

Conclusion
Taiwan has long been heavily targeted by espionage threat actors and ‘Lotus Blossom’ is one of the most active threat
actors currently targeting the country. The analysis presented in this blog provides an overview of one of their latest
malware variants and new network infrastructure associated with the group. The compile time of the sample shows
that the malware was compiled in November which indicates that the group is still actively targeting Taiwanese
victims.
