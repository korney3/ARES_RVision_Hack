While many of the headline-grabbing cyber security breaches of 2014 involved major U.S. 
companies, Southeast Asia quietly dealt 
with its share of cyber attacks. Like the U.S., 
companies in this region face a complex 
threat landscape filled with advanced cyber 
attackers intent on stealing corporate data 
and state secrets.

Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors  
are one of the biggest challenges for the 
region. Leading companies that do business 
in the energy, telecommunications, high-
tech, finance, and transportation sectors are 
targets of APT groups. 

This report describes malware detected at 
commercial and government entities across 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, 
Philippines, Indonesia, and Brunei. It also discusses 
advanced threat groups behind many of these 
attacks and their unique motives in this region.

THE MISSION IS TWO-FOLD:

Steal intellectual 
property and inside 
information from 
leading companies. 

INTRODUCTION

Obtain intelligence on rival 
governments during long-
running political disputes, 
especially those involving the 
disputed South China Sea.

SOUTHEAST ASIA 

CYBER THREATS  
TO KEY INDUSTRIES

CYBER THREATS  
TO GOVERNMENTS 

From July to December 2014, FireEye 
products helped 29 percent of our 
customers in Southeast Asia detect 
malware used by APT groups and other 
actors targeting their networks. 

Southeast Asian companies regularly 
attract the interest of cyber spies and 
criminals looking to steal information 
about the region’s growing industry 
sectors—energy, telecommunications, 
high-tech, transportation, and finance.

Territorial disputes in the South China 
Sea drive cyber espionage activity in 
Southeast Asia. Both government and 
private industries are targets of threat 
actors seeking to steal information in 
these disputes. 

Detecting Targeted Threats in 
Southeast Asia and Beyond
From July to December 2014, FireEye products 
helped 29 percent of our customers in Southeast 
Asia detect malware used by APT groups and 
other attackers targeting their networks. When 
factoring in the rest of our Asia-Pacific clients, that 
percentage jumps to 37 percent—significantly 
higher than the global average of 27 percent. 
(These statistics are generated from customers 
who have opted to share anonymized data 
through FireEye.)

In the Asia-Pacific region, FireEye 
products helped 37% of our customers 
detect malware.

Targeted Malware, Industry Breakdown
More than half of the targeted malware that FireEye detected in Southeast Asia came from government 
and telecommunications sites. (Note: these statistics do not account for the number of appliances at a 
customer site or the number of FireEye customers in a given industry.)

Detecting Non-Targeted Threats
In addition to the targeted and APT malware, 
organizations in the region frequently detect other 
threats, including banking Trojans, botnets, and 
other types of cyber crime.

Regionally, our customers most frequently detect 
Zeus (a banking Trojan) and Sality (a multi-featured 
Trojan) on their networks. 

These commodity malware families are widely 
known, but dismissing the threat they pose is  
a mistake. 

For one, they continue to evade detection by 
traditional security tools, making them highly 
effective. And advanced threat groups often 
use these common malware families to gain a 
foothold into corporate environments.

SOUTHEAST ASIA’S 
LEADING INDUSTRY 
SECTORS ATTRACT  
APT ACTORS

We observe APT groups routinely targeting companies in Southeast Asia to steal intellectual property (IP). We 
believe that once stolen, this IP often makes its 
way to Chinese companies. These companies can 
use the stolen IP to bypass years of research and 
development costs and get an inside edge when 
they deal with competitors in the region. 

As increasing investments and diversifying 
economies spur development in the region, this 
growth simultaneously becomes even more 
attractive to APT groups. 

Southeast Asia’s financial sector faces a dual 
threat. First, standard cybercriminals are looking 
to steal money from them. Second, advanced 
threat actors are seeking sensitive financial 
information for a business advantage. 

These industry sectors appear to be most heavily targeted by APT groups:

ENERGY TELECOMMUNICATIONS HIGH-TECH TRANSPORTATION FINANCIAL SERVICES

The following table outlines some of the targeted sectors and why APT groups would target companies’ information:

Sector Why are APT Groups 
Interested?

Recent Cases Most Likely Corporate 
Targets

Energy APT groups have long  
targeted U.S. and multinational 
corporations with strong 
offerings in green technology 
and other clean energy 
production. R&D breakthroughs 
in this sector would provide 
tremendous value to China’s 
energy sector, especially in 
light of continued international 
pressure to lower emissions. 

Southeast Asia is an important 
potential source of hydrocarbon 
reserves. The disputed territories 
in the South China Sea are 
estimated to contain a considerable 
amount of natural gas and 
petroleum. As rapid economic 
growth creates a surge in energy 
demand, energy resources in the 
disputed maritime territories have 
become increasingly valuable. 
All of these factors are likely to 
provoke further APT activity. 

FireEye has observed multiple 
instances of APT groups 
breaching the networks of 
regional energy companies.  
In one case, we discovered 
three different threat groups 
attempting to gain access to 
the network of an oil company 
that conducts offshore oil 
exploration.  

The threat groups appeared 
to target affiliates of the 
company, as well as its 
infrastructure development 
divisions. We believe these 
threat groups chiefly sought 
data of competitive value. But 
they were also on the lookout 
for any information about the 
company’s exploration plans 
and movements in the area.

We have also observed targeted 
threat actors deploying malware 
against the networks of a major 
electric grid operator in the region.

• Green Energy Technology 
Researchers and Providers

• Utilities

• Oil and Gas Producers

• Critical Infrastructure 
Providers and Operators

Recent Cases Most Likely Corporate 
Targets

Telecommunications We have observed one 
APT group, which we call 
APT5, particularly focused 
on telecommunications and 
technology companies. More 
than half of the organizations 
we have observed being 
targeted or breached by APT5 
operate in these sectors. Several 
times, APT5 has targeted 
organizations and personnel 
based in Southeast Asia.  

APT5 has been active since 
at least 2007. It appears to 
be a large threat group that 
consists of several subgroups, 
often with distinct tactics 
and infrastructure. APT5 
has targeted or breached 
organizations across multiple 
industries, but its focus appears 
to be on telecommunications 
and technology companies, 
especially information about 
satellite communications.

APT5 targeted the network of 
an electronics firm that sells 
products for both industrial 
and military applications. The 
group subsequently stole 
communications related to the 
firm’s business relationship with 
a national military, including 
inventories and memoranda 
about specific products they 
provided. 

 In one case in late 2014, 
APT5 breached the 
network of an international 
telecommunications company. 
The group used malware with 
keylogging capabilities to 
monitor the computer of an 
executive who manages the 
company’s relationships with 
other telecommunications 
companies. This method 
allowed APT5 to collect data on 
topics such as:

• Pricing discussions, bidding 
strategies and competitor 
pricing information

• Schedules for contract 
bidding and product 
deployment 

• Opportunities in Asian 
telecommunications market 

• Business opportunities with 
other  telecommunications 
companies

APT5 also targeted the 
networks of some of 
Southeast Asia’s major 
telecommunications providers 
with Leouncia malware. We 
suspect that the group sought 
access to these networks 
to obtain information that 
would enable it to monitor 
communications passing 
through the providers’ systems.  

• Regional 
Telecommunication 
Providers

• Asia-Based Employees of 
Global Telecommunications 
and Tech Firms

• High-Tech Manufacturing

• Military Application

Recent Cases Most Likely Corporate 
Targets

Transportation APT groups likely target 
the region’s transportation 
companies to monitor the 
progress of high-profile projects 
that have the potential to fuel 
continued economic growth in 
the region.

In one case, a threat group 
that has historically focused 
its operations on targets in 
the Philippines and Malaysia 
spoofed the domain names of 
two well-known international 
shipping companies. One of the 
spoofed companies was a major 
commercial freight company 
that transports commodities 
around the globe. The other 
was a regional shipbuilding 
company. The plausible URLs 
were designed to entice 
potential victims within 
targeted industries to click. 

Another APT group targeted 
a major operator of container 
ship terminals in Southeast Asia. 
We suspect the group targeted 
the port operator to monitor 
its communications with 
regional security and military 
organizations that partner with 
the company. 

A threat group targeted a rail 
operator. We detected variants 
of the Lecna/BackSpace APT 
malware in the transit company’s 
networks in early 2014.

• Shipping Companies 

• Port Operators

• Airlines

• Public Transit Systems

Financial Services Banks in Southeast Asia appear 
to face a double threat. The first 
is the pernicious cybercrime 
activity we observe around 
the world, such as credit card 
fraud and the theft of banking 
credentials. The second threat 
is focused specifically on banks 
with a development mission in 
the region.

In one case, a threat group 
targeted a development bank 
that invests in the growth of 
strategic projects and industries 
in the region. 

In another instance, we saw two 
different threat groups infect 
the networks of a central bank. 
Stolen data on the country’s 
monetary policies and banking 
system could be highly valuable 
information to someone looking 
to understand and anticipate 
broader banking and funding 
trends in the country and region.

• Banks

• Companies Funding Major 
Regional Development 
Projects

• Institutions Dealing With 
Monetary Policy

Banks that invest in the region’s strategic 
growth face more threats than traditional 
credit card fraud and financial hackers.

REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND MILITARIES: 
IN APT GROUPS’ CROSSHAIRS

The APT groups that we track actively target governments and militaries for inside information into negotiations and political 
issues. APT groups that target governments in the 
region are frequently interested in topics related 
to the South China Sea. And they are increasingly 
active during times of heightened political tension 
or transition.

APT Groups and the South China 
Sea: Territorial Disputes with a 
Digital Edge 
FireEye routinely observes APT groups steal 
information dealing with South China Sea disputes 
and their economic effects from the networks of 
governments and companies involved. Control 
over territory in the South China Sea is a fiercely 
contested issue between China, the Philippines, 
Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. 

The territorial disputes have huge consequences 
for each claimant's national and economic security. 
The stakes are high: more than half of the world's 
commercial shipping passes through the South 
China Sea. It contains potential reserves of up to 
11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas, and prime fishing areas.

Territorial disputes have lingered for decades. 
Along with militaries and coast guards of claimant 
countries, South China Sea disputes involve 
regional oil firms, cargo companies, and fisheries. 
The territory has been at the center of many 
international incidents, reflecting the considerable 
national and economic security implications for 
the rival claimants.

Threat Groups Target Southeast 
Asian Governments and Militaries 
over Territorial Claims
Southeast Asian government and military entities 
have been targeted several times in what we 
suspect are efforts to obtain intelligence related  
to territorial disputes.

• An APT group stole data from one country’s 
government and military networks on several 
occasions, including a period of heightened 
tension over competing claims in the South 
China Sea.1  

Some of the files that the APT group took 
included the following:

 – General military documents
 – Internal communications
 – Equipment maintenance reports and 

specifications
 – Event-related materials
 – Documentation of organizational 

programs and initiatives 

• Other threat groups have targeted a country’s 
air force with spear-phishing emails that 
referenced the country’s military and regional 
maritime disputes. These emails were designed 
to appear to originate from email accounts 
associated with other elements of the military. 

• Other threat actors have used the Grillmark 
backdoor to attempt to gain access to the 
networks of two countries’ government and 
military entities. These threat actors targeted 
their victims through spear-phishing emails 
that contained weaponized documents relating 
to either diplomatic or military affairs.

APT Groups Gather  
Political Intelligence 
In August 2014, an APT group appeared to 
target intelligence related to a Southeast Asia 
government. The threat actors sent a spear-
phishing email that referenced the country’s 
leadership and contained a document with 
sections extracted from related news articles.  
The email appeared to originate from a 
compromised intelligence agency email account, 
although the threat actors may have faked the 
email address. Many of the email’s recipients 
were associated with the targeted country’s 
government and military or were involved in intel-
sharing partnerships. In either case, the recipient 
would likely have access to information regarding 
the country’s security and internal stability. 

Government and military entities are 
frequently targeted with malware that 
steals sensitive security details.

CONCLUSION 

Public and private organizations in the Southeast Asian region are prime targets for advanced threat groups. The data is clear:  
targeted threat actors are focused on getting into 
the networks of and stealing from fast-growing 
industries, as well as from organizations involved 
in territorial claims over the South China Sea.
