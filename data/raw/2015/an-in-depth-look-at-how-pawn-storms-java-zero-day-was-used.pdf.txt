An In-Depth Look at How Pawn Storm’s Java Zero-Day Was
Used

Posted in: Exploits, Malware, Targeted Attacks Author: Trend
Micro

Operation Pawn Storm is a campaign known to target military, embassy, and defense contractor
personnel from the United States and its allies. The attackers behind Operation Pawn Storm have been
active since at least 2007 and they continue to launch new campaigns.

Over the past year or so, we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign,
such as the use of an iOS espionage app, and the inclusion of new targets like the White House.
Through our on-going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign, we found
suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero-day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as
CVE-2015-2590. This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero-day vulnerability  was
reported.

The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack, not the exploit itself. Our blog entry
on how the exploit itself works can be found here. This blog entry is intended to help readers identify
traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred. We strongly recommend
that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible

Infection sequence

Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains
the following URL:

hxxp://ausameetings[.]com/url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/

It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com, a play on the valid
domain “ausameetings.org,” which is a site for AUSA’s (Association of the United States Army) annual
exposition, commonly held in mid-October. The domain was only registered last July 8, which implies a
one-time use for a specific set of targets.

When assessing this URL, it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is:

Figure 1. Infection chain

Like all multi-stage infections, a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to
the next stage down. In Stage 1, the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URL embedded within the
victim’s spearphishing email.

Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful, it downloads the PE file (Stage 2). Once the PE file is
downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLL file (Stage 3) which is the final component to infect
the machine with SEDNIT.

The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows.
Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below.

Send the initial POST as per the spearphishing email to ausameetings[.]com, which includes the2015annualmeeting URI path.2. Send an encoded POST call, which, when decoded, is the variable to construct the subsequentlyused URI path. This is particularly interesting as it appears that each URI path on the malicious
server is customized by the victim’s infection, rather than static on the web server.

3. The victim machine then does a variety of GET calls to pull down JPG, JNLP, and Java class files.

4. If the Java class files cannot be found on the primarily domain ( ausameetings[.]com), it appears to
instead attempt to get these files from a hardcoded IP (87[.]236[.]215[.]132).

5. Once the class files are downloaded, the victim machine then does a GET call to fetch the file
cormac.mcr. This file is the PE file for Stage 2.

For completeness, the specific traffic calls observed relating to Stage 1 include the following:

Result Protocol Host URL Size Content-Type

Trend Micro detects these Java class files as JAVA_DLOADR.EFD:

App.class (7,552 bytes)

Go.class (1,373 bytes)

Help.class (5,667 bytes)

The second and third traffic calls in the traffic pattern are particularly interesting to note.

Figure 2. Traffic patterns (click the image to enlarge)

One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com, and is returned with a text
responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests.

Stage 2 – The PE file

Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file. Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC. The
primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLL executable. It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr,
but once extracted, the file name is converted into a randomized file name. It is installed into
the %USERPROFILE% directory and then executed, creating a service by the same name.



During its installation, a variety of other services also appear to be hooked, including lsass, lsm,
and conhost, amongst others.

Figure 3. Observed processes (click the image to enlarge)

Once the malware is executed, it will drop the Stage 3 DLL file with filename api-ms-win-downlevel-
profile-l1-1-0.dll in the %TEMP% directory. To load the malware, it executes rundll32.exe using the
following command:

rundll32.exe “%temp%/api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,init

Stage 3 – The DLL file

This third stage involves a DLL file, which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the
DLL (in this instance, %windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command:
“%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe ” “C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i-ms-win-
downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,init), the following traffic was observed.

1 POST /ESL/YxF8bM/f/MFS.pdf/?duJ=OJYKZRlzy1tddcpaKjU= HTTP/1.1

It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own
analysis. The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have
polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files. After assessing the
samples multiple times, each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different, no matter
what sequence of testing was performed (e.g., same machine, different machines, different geographic
IP space globally, etc.).

After detailed network forensics of the traffic, it was determined that no single stable URL path or URI
query component (URI path component, file name, or URI query parameter) showed a consistent
pattern (either same entry nor regex definable pattern), and further reverse engineering was required to
determine the methods used to achieve this.

As a result of this additional analysis, it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string
with the following pattern:

^/([a-zA-Z0-9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID>



Figure 4. Regex expression

Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption. The encoded data
contains the following system information of the infected machine:

OS Version

List of running processes

Hard Disk Drive Information

Volume Serial Number

TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers:

192[.]111[.]146[.]185 (direct to IP call)

www[.]acledit[.]com

www[.]biocpl[.]org

After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above.

Phase 2 of the attack: the keystroke logger

Based on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm, we know that the infection happens in two
stages:

In phase 1, opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of
the first level dropper, which installs the downloader component (.DLL file).

In phase 2, the downloader component communicates with a C&C server and downloads other
components, and at the end of the chain a keylogger is installer. The keylogger sends data back to
the C&C server.

As of writing, we have not succeeded in triggering Phase 2, which will download a fourth stage
malware from the C&C servers. This fourth stage malware is expected to be an encrypted executable
file.

Victims of the Attack

A number of victims were identified during the course of our investigation. The targets are in the United
States or Canada, and those we were able to identify via IP are big defense contractors, as typical for
Operation PawnStorm.
