Executive summary
Highlights of Q3 2019 include:

 � Unique cyberincidents are growing, with a six-percent increase in 

their number compared to the previous quarter.

 � Targeted attacks continue to predominate over mass ones: 65 

percent of the total in Q3 versus 59 percent in Q2. Organizations 

around the world are at risk of APT attacks. Top targets of APT 

groups include governments, industrial companies, the financial 

sector, and science and education.

 � TA505, an APT group, has expanded its reach to new countries 

and sectors.

 � By a two-to-one ratio, data theft is a more common motivation for 

attackers than direct financial gain.

 � Personal data accounted for one quarter of all data stolen from or-

ganizations. From individuals, data thieves most frequently made 

off with usernames and passwords (which comprised 47% of data 

stolen from individuals).

 � Malware infections are on the rise. Three quarters of attacks on 

organizations, and nearly two thirds of attacks on individuals, in-

volved malware infections.

 � Spyware was responsible for one in three malware infections 

among both organizations and individuals. Just as ransomware 

accounts for a high percentage of infections of organizations 

(27%), adware hits individuals particularly hard (21%).

 � In 81 percent of cases, malware infections of corporate infrastruc-

ture started with a phishing message. For individuals, the most 

frequent attack vector included visiting a malicious website: 35 

percent of malware infections in Q3 took place in this way.

Statistics
In Q3, data theft was the motivation for 61 percent of attacks on organizations and 64 percent of attacks 

on individuals (compared to 58% and 55%, respectively, in Q2). Direct financial gain, at 31 percent, was 

equally popular as motivation for attacks against both organizations and individuals. Attackers seeking 

direct financial gain from organizations generally use ransomware to demand a ransom for decrypting 

the victim's data. Against individuals, such direct gain tends to involve intrusive advertising and mobile 

apps with subscriptions to paid services.

Breaches of personal data remain a major concern. In Q3, personal data accounted for one fourth of all 

data stolen from organizations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took force in 2018. This 

September, reports appeared of a EUR 645,000 fine for a Polish shopping site after a breach of personal 

data for over 2 million site visitors in the previous year.

One out of five (19%) of attacks in Q3 targeted individuals. Almost half (47%) of data stolen from individ-

uals consisted of credentials. Users may fall victim to clever phishing attacks designed to trick them into 

revealing usernames and passwords. For example, over 200 clients of Halyk Bank in Kazakhstan failed 

to notice a slight discrepancy in the online address of the bank. As a result, they entered their credentials 

on a fraudulent site designed to imitate the real one.

The high proportion of targeted attacks is a trend we have noticed accelerating in 2019. From 47 percent 

in the first quarter, they rose to 59 percent in the second quarter and now 65 percent in the third quarter. 

We associate this trend with increased activity by APT groups. In Q3, the PT Expert Security Center (PT 

ESC) detected attacks by APT groups including TA505, RTM, Cobalt, Bronze Union, APT-C-35, KONNI, 

and Gamaredon.

Attackers continue to be interested in government targets. Such targets accounted for 23 percent of 

attacks, representing an increase of 4 percentage points over Q2. Attackers also pursue targets relating 

to industrial companies, finance, and education and science. We will detail some of these attacks later 

in this report.

As before, the most common cyberattack method is malware infection combined with social engineer-

ing. In Q3, three quarters (74%) of attacks on organizations involved infection with malware, represent-

ing an increase of 13 percentage points over Q2.

Attack methods
Here we will describe the attack methods used by criminals, based on some of the highest-profile cy-

berincidents in Q3 2019.

Malware use

During the third quarter, the PT ESC regularly recorded attacks by APT group TA505. The group's arse-

nal includes Dridex (a banking trojan), Cryptomix (ransomware signed with certificates issued to dummy 

legal entities), ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy (remote administration trojans), and Upxxec (a plugin able 

to detect and disable a large range of antivirus software). The attackers made active use of phishing to 

send messages to organizations around the world related to finance, industry, government, science, and 

transportation. Some of their campaigns are analyzed in more detail in individual sections of this report.

In Q3, our experts also detected new activity by Bronze Union (also known as LuckyMouse or APT27), 

which uses ZxShell malware for remote access. The malware components had been digitally signed with 

compromised certificates belonging to various companies. Once installed, ZxShell is difficult to detect 

with normal antivirus techniques: the attackers place a special rootkit on infected systems to swap out 

the installation paths to malware modules with the paths to legitimate utilities upon access.

Figure 8. ZxShell installer signed with a compromised certificate

The operators of the Sodinokibi ransomware, which we already covered in the second quarter, continue 

to act aggressively. A breach of cloud provider PerCSoft resulted in encryption of data belonging to 

the company's client base of approximately 400 dental clinics. In August, over 20 Texas communities 

fell victim to this ransomware. The attackers constantly invent new methods for placing Sodinokibi on 

victim computers.

In the third quarter, mining software fell to 3 percent of attacks on organizations and just 2 percent of 

attacks on individuals. In our view, this is because attackers are gradually switching to malware with 

multifunction capabilities. One example is the Clipsa trojan, which can stealthily mine cryptocurrency, 

steal passwords, tamper with addresses of cryptocurrency wallets, and launch brute-force attacks 

against WordPress sites.

In late August, Emotet (one of the largest botnets in the world) resumed activity after a lull of several 

months. The botnet's operators offer malware as a service (MaaS): by providing access to Emotet-

infected computers, they enable other cybercriminals to infect victims with additional malware. Since 

September, they have been sending out malicious mailings disguised as invoices, financial documents, 

and even a free version of the new book by Edward Snowden. The attachments to these messages 

infect the victim with the Emotet trojan. With it, the botnet operators can place yet more malware on 

compromised devices, such as the Trickbot trojan or Ryuk ransomware, which are frequently found 

together on infected machines. 

Figure 10. Malware distribution methods 

Social engineering

For attackers, social engineering is a perennial favorite. This method figured in 69 percent of attacks 

on organizations in the third quarter, compared to 37 percent in the second quarter. Cybercriminals 

continue to rack up huge amounts by forging messages or employing business email compromise 

(BEC) to send phishing messages. They present themselves as belonging to a trusted company (such 

as a vendor) and send an invoice with their own bank account number. In the state of North Carolina, 

Cabarrus County received an email stating that the account number of the county's construction con-

tractor had changed. Not realizing that the message was a fake, the county transferred $2.5 million to

an account belonging to cybercriminals instead of the contractor. A similar attack hit Toyota Boshoku 

Corporation, which lost a whopping $37.5 million. According to the U.S.-based Internet Crime 

Complaint Center (IC3), worldwide losses from BEC fraud in the last three years top $26 billion.

A malicious link, even if sent from a trusted address, can be blocked by email security gateways. But 

cybercriminals keep finding ways to evade anti-phishing systems. In Q3, attackers sent messages to 

bank employees with a link to a compromised SharePoint site. There the attackers had posted a doc-

ument with another link, which led victims to a fake page asking for their username and password. If 

the phishing link had been included directly in the email message, anti-phishing systems might have 

blocked it. But SharePoint links had been whitelisted and therefore were not blocked.

Figure 11. Phishing attack involving compromised SharePoint resources

Hacking

As we regularly remind readers, it is critical to keep software up to date. When a software vulnerability 

becomes known to the public, the first to get attacked are the organizations and individuals who have 

failed to install the relevant updates quickly. In one example in Q3, the eGobbler criminal group respon-

sible for inserting malicious ads into web pages continued to exploit vulnerability CVE-2019-5840, af-

fecting the Chrome browser for iOS, which had been patched back in June. But soon after the browser 

update was released, eGobbler found a new vulnerability, this time in the WebKit engine. The vulnera-

bility allows displaying pop-up ads every time the keyboard is used for site navigation. The vulnerability 

has been fixed in iOS 13 and Safari 13.0.1. 

Last quarter, we mentioned critical RDS vulnerability CVE-2019-0708, better known as BlueKeep. In 

August, Microsoft fixed another two vulnerabilities in RDS. These new critical vulnerabilities CVE-2019-

1181 and CVE-2019-1182 resemble BlueKeep but affect more recent versions of Windows, including serv-

er versions.

Web attacks

In late September, an exploit became public for a zero-day vulnerability in the vBulletin forum engine. 

News spread quickly of Remote Code Execution vulnerability CVE-2019-16759, exploitation of which 

does not require logging in to a vulnerable forum. Some security experts state that they had knowledge 

of the vulnerability years prior. At the end of September, the issue with vBulletin enabled attackers to 

breach the Comodo forums. Reports indicate that data for over 170,000 users is being sold on the 

darkweb.

For users who make online purchases, MageCart JavaScript sniffers remain a hazard. These sniffers are 

small scripts that attackers use to infect sites with online payment functionality. In Q3 2019, Trend Micro 

researchers discovered malicious scripts on the sites of two major hotel chains. The attacks affected 

guests who paid for their stays via mobile devices. Experts established that the hotels had fallen victim 

to a supply chain attack. MageCart sniffers were placed on the site by means of an infected JavaScript 

library. This library was used by the company responsible for developing both of the hotel sites.

But web security is an issue for more than just online services and Internet stores. A file upload vulner-

ability in property management software SuperINN Plus enabled attackers to hack the application by 

uploading a web shell (a PHP script that, when run on a server, enables remote command execution). In 

addition, the attackers were able to perform SQL injection. They obtained the encrypted card numbers, 

personal data, and contact details for over 43,000 people. The attackers are believed to have succeed-

ed in obtaining the decryption key. This incident underscores the need to regularly audit the security of 

web applications. Arbitrary File Upload is a widespread critical vulnerability, which in 2018 our experts 

found in one out of every four web applications tested. 

Credential compromise

No company is immune to compromised credentials. In so-called credential stuffing attacks, criminals 

try to obtain access to a system by re-using usernames and passwords already stolen in previous at-

tacks or acquired elsewhere (such on the darkweb). In Q3 2019, credential stuffing struck Transport for 

London, which is responsible for managing the city's transportation network. The website for its Oyster 

system was temporarily closed due to the attack. Another victim was State Farm, a financial services and 

insurance company. Overall, research from Akamai indicates that from November 2017 through April 

2019, 6.1 percent of credential stuffing attacks were directed at the financial sector.

Hackers eagerly eye government targets. Ministries and departments, agencies, and city governments 

are at constant risk of sophisticated targeted attacks. We have noted that some criminal groups seeking 

to steal money do so by attacking governments. In Q3 2019, the PT ESC detected phishing mailings by 

TA505 to governmental entities in South Korea, China, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The RTM group has also turned its gaze to government. In Q3, PT ESC experts detected phishing mes-

sages sent to governmental organizations in Russia and Belarus.

PT ESC has also noted attacks on government entities by the Gamaredon group. The attackers are inter-

ested only in entities related to the Ukrainian government: their C2 servers filter by geographic region. 

In their attacks, the group uses a chain of scripts that download the Ultra VNC remote control utility to 

the victim's computer.

Figure 17. Industrial companies: attack methods used in Q3 2019

In addition in Q3, the PT ESC recorded attacks by APT-C-35 (also known as Donot). The group sent 

phishing mailings containing an Office document linking to an RTF file, which contained an exploit for 

vulnerability CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office Equation Editor. yty malicious modules were installed 

on compromised computers.

Ransomware operators also have governments in their sights. They hope to receive large payouts for 

restoring encrypted files. And their appetites are constantly increasing. Besides Sodinokibi attacks on 

governments in Texas, mentioned already in the report, another wave of attacks by Ryuk ransomware 

hit throughout the U.S. La Porte County in Indiana paid ransom of $130,000 to cybercriminals. In New 

Bedford, Massachusetts, attackers demanded ransom of $5.3 million, but failed to receive it.

In 2018, we wrote about attacks on Click2Gov, an Internet portal used in many American cities to pay 

for municipal services. A second wave of attacks was seen in Q3 2019. The victims in August were eight 

cities, six of which had already fallen victim to previous attacks on Click2Gov.

In Q3, PT ESC experts detected attacks by the TA505 APT group on American companies in the 

food industry, pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment suppliers. The group also attacked 

industrial and energy-related companies in South Korea and Taiwan, as well as high-tech engineering 

companies in a number of European countries. The attackers sent phishing emails with Office documents 

that infected victim computers with FlawedAmmyy remote administration malware. In addition, in July 

our experts detected mailings to industrial companies in South Korea in which victims were infected 

with the ServHelper trojan. The malware was disguised by the attackers as ISO files. The PT ESC has 

identified two modifications of ServHelper: one can be used as a RAT, while the other acts as loader for 

the legitimate remote control software NetSupport Manager.

In August, reports appeared of an attack with LokiBot spyware on an American industrial company. The 

malware was delivered to the company's infrastructure in an email message supposedly from a partner 

company.

Restoring infrastructure at an industrial company after a targeted attack can take large investments of 

time and money. At the end of the quarter, major German military equipment manufacturer Rheinmetall 

announced that it had been hit by a cyberattack. This led to interruptions in business processes at the 

company's facilities in Brazil, Mexico, and the U.S. Downtime-related losses cost the company millions 

of euros per week. Rheinmetall estimated that restoring operations would take from two to four weeks.

Cobalt, a financially driven APT group, remains active. Check Point announced attacks by Cobalt on 

banks in Kazakhstan in the third quarter. PT ESC experts detected phishing mailings to Russian and 

European banks. As spear phishing emails, they are carefully prepared and well composed. In July, the 

group sent messages from a hacked email address belonging to an employee of a Moscow airport.

In the first half of September, the PT ESC noted phishing messages from TA505 to European and African 

banks. The group used Office documents with macros as their attachment of choice. These extract a 

DLL, save it, and run the new FlawedAmmyy loader.

In Q3, the share of attacks targeting science and education grew to 9 percent, compared to 6 percent 

in the quarter prior. One possible reason is the start of the academic year. Schools are on the receiving 

end of numerous ransomware attacks. Cyberattacks on Louisiana schools led to declaration of a state 

of emergency.

The APT group Cobalt Dickens has resumed its hunt for intellectual property. Experts at Secureworks 

indicated that among the regular recipients of the group's phishing messages, there are 60 educational 

institutions. In these messages, the criminals lured victims to fake library websites, on which users were 

asked to log in. By entering their username and password on the page, users effectively handed their 

credentials over to attackers.

In summer 2019, Microsoft detected new malware, which was dubbed Nodersok. Most Nodersok in-

fections (42%) are in the educational sector. Infections take place via malicious website advertising. 

Compromise begins with download of an HTA file. The result of this multistage attack is that the comput-

er is infected with malware that turns it into a proxy server for forwarding malicious traffic.

What companies can do to stay safe

Use proven security solutions

 � Centrally manage software updates and patches. To prioritize update plans 

correctly, the most pressing security threats must be taken into account.

 � Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and 

the ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments 

before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should 

simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability 

to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious 

activity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file 

storage, and web portals. It should be able to check files both in real time 

and retrospectively, by automatically re-scanning files when signature data-

bases are updated to detect previously unknown threats.

 � We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective 

response to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious 

activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence, and en-

able prompt measures to neutralize threats.

 � Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.

 � Deploy web application firewalls as a preventive measure.

 � Detect sophisticated targeted attacks in real time and in saved traffic with 

deep traffic analysis. Using such solutions will allow you to detect previously 

unnoticed attacks and monitor network attacks in real time, including use of 

malware and hacking tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and at-

tacks on the domain controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attacker 

presence in the infrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and 

disruption to business systems, and decreases the financial damage caused 

by attackers.

 � Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.

Protect your data

 � Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where 

it can be publicly accessed.

 � Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are iso-

lated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.

 � Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.

 � Use a different username and password for each site or service.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged 

accounts.

Do not allow weak passwords

 � Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.



21

 � Require password changes every 90 days.

 � Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

Monitor the security situation

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

 � Test and educate employees regarding information security.

 � Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. 

Regularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their se-

curity, and remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor 

the news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in identifying 

affected resources and taking necessary measures.

 � Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces acces-

sible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote 

management of servers and network equipment. 

 � Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking 

internal infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.

 � Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code 

analysis, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application sys-

tems and clients at risk of attack.

 � Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources. 

Configure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenari-

os (such as TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).

Help clients to stay safe

 � Improve security awareness among clients.

 � Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common 

attacks.

 � Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not 

give out such information by email or over the phone.

 � Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.

 � Inform of security-related events.

How vendors can secure their products

 � All the measures described for organizations, plus:

 � Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).

 � Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including 

source-code analysis.

 � Keep web servers and database software up to date. 

 � Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.



22

How users can avoid falling victim

Do not skimp on security

 � Use only licensed software. 

 � Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

Protect your data

 � Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a 

copy on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.

 � Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.

Do not use trivial passwords

 � Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, 

numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to 

create and store passwords securely.

 � Do not re-use passwords. Set a unique password for each site, email 

account, and system that you use.

 � Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every 

two to three months.

Be vigilant

 � Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.

 � Be mindful of sites with invalid certificates. Remember that data entered on 

such sites could be intercepted by criminals.

 � Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.

 � Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning 

appears. 

 � Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or 

product being advertised.

 � Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the 

most important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from 

our own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from 

authoritative sources.

For the purposes of this report, any particular mass incident (such as a vi-

rus attack in which criminals send phishing messages to a large number of 

targets) is counted as one unique security threat. Terms used in this report:

A cyberthreat is a combination of factors and circumstances that create 

the risk of information security compromise. In this report, we look at cyber-

threats in terms of the actions of malefactors in cyberspace who attempt 

to breach an information system in order to steal money or data, or with 

other intentions potentially causing harm to government, business, or indi-

viduals. Attacker actions may be directed against the target company's IT 

infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other equipment, or at people 

as a factor in cyberspace.

A cyberattack consists of unauthorized actions targeting information sys-

tems by cybercriminals leveraging techniques and software to obtain ac-

cess to information, impair the normal functioning or availability of systems, 

or to steal, alter, or delete information.

An attack target is the target of unauthorized actions by cybercriminals. In 

cases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly from 

an individual, client, or employee, the attack target is "Humans." On the 

other hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place malware 

on corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individual, the attack 

target is "Computers, servers, and network equipment."

Attack motive is the overall goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in 

theft of payment card information, the motive is "data theft."

Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. For instance, 

an attacker might perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network ser-

vices available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to re-

sources or information. For the purposes of this report, such a process is 

referred to as "hacking." Credential compromise and web attacks are put in 

separate categories for greater granularity.

Victim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked com-

panies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate with respect 

to employer). For example, the "Hospitality and entertainment" category 

includes companies providing paid services, such as consulting agencies, 

hotels, and restaurants. The "Online services" category includes platforms 

where users can fulfill their needs online, such as ticket and hotel aggrega-

tor websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social media 

resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale cyber-

attacks affecting more than one industry (most often, malware outbreaks) 

have been placed in the "Multiple industries" category.

In our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to repu-

tational risks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents 

and analyze activity by hacker groups are unable to perform a precise count. 

This research is conducted in order to draw the attention of companies and 



24

ordinary individuals who care about the state of information security to the 

key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main 

trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.

Group profiles
APT-C-35 (Donot, SectorE02), active since 2016, attacks organizations in 

South Asia: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and 

countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The attackers take the 

guise of governmental institutions, military entities, and telecom companies.

Bronze Union, also known as TG-3390, LuckyMouse, APT27, or Emissary 

Panda, has been involved in cyberespionage attacks since 2010. To gain 

a foothold on networks, the group often uses watering hole attacks: they 

target the websites frequented by targeted users and place malware on 

the websites in order to automatically infect visitors' computers. Currently 

the group targets governmental entities and companies involved in indus-

try, military manufacturing, energy, aerospace, and other high-tech fields 

around the world.

Cobalt has been known since 2016 for its attacks on financial institutions. 

The group started off by stealing from banks in CIS countries. Since 2017, 

it has expanded its range of targets to include banks in Eastern Europe 

and Southeast Asia. The group was named after Cobalt Strike, the pene-

tration testing software used by the group to develop attacks within target 

networks. Its primary method of breaching corporate networks is phishing 

messages with malicious files in various formats: executable files, Office 

documents with macros or exploits, LNK files, and passworded archives 

containing executable files.

Cobalt Dickens first caught attention in 2017. In 2019, the group attacked at 

least 380 post-secondary educational institutions in over 30 countries in or-

der to obtain intellectual property. University faculty and students received 

phishing messages claiming to come from libraries. The messages pointed 

to phishing pages, where users were prompted to enter their credentials, 

which were then used by the attackers to access research of interest.

eGobbler, known since early 2019, exploited Chrome vulnerability CVE-

2019-5840 to show malicious advertising to users of iOS mobile devices. In 

the second half of 2019, the group increased its reach to all WebKit brows-

ers, including desktop versions, running on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

From August 1 to September 23, the group was able to show around 1.16 bil-

lion impressions to potential victims, in the hope of drawing them to fraud-

ulent and phishing-related sites.

Gamaredon has been active since 2013. The attackers focus exclusively 

on Ukrainian governmental entities: their C2 servers perform filtering by 

geographic region. In their attacks, the group uses a chain of scripts to 

download the Ultra VNC remote management utility to the victim's com-

puter. They use a self-developed framework named Pteranodon for full-

fledged management of infected hosts. With it, the attackers can collect 

information about the system and users, steal passwords, run scripts and 

commands, and exfiltrate information to C2 servers.

KONNI has been active since at least 2014. The group's name comes from 

the malware named KONNI, which it used in its attacks. The malware can 



25

steal files containing sensitive information, intercept and save passwords 

entered by users, take screenshots, and run commands on infected com-

puters. The main objective of the group is espionage and access to data.

The history of RTM dates back to 2016. The group attempts to access cor-

porate bank accounts and steal funds. They use phishing messages to ob-

tain access to corporate networks. Since the very start, the group has used 

a consistent format in such messages. Positive Technologies data indicates 

that in 2018 alone, the group carried out 59 mailings, the recipients of which 

included financial institutions. In 2019, the group moved to use of the Bitcoin 

blockchain. Most targets are financial institutions, although cases have also 

included industry, government, and IT-related organizations. In addition, 

the group has used .bit domains for C2. The .bit zone is powered by the 

Namecoin blockchain, which acts as a censor-proof and confiscation-re-

sistant alternative to traditional DNS registrars. Experts at the PT Expert 

Security Center were able to use the blockchain architecture to devise an 

algorithm for monitoring registration of new domains by RTM and changes 

in their IP addresses. This enabled warning financial institutions and the se-

curity community of new C2 servers in a matter of minutes (or sometimes 

even before) they entered use by the attackers.

TA505 has operated since 2014. The group's targets include major financial, 

manufacturing, transportation, and governmental organizations in Canada, 

South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and dozens of other 

countries. Phishing messages are the group's main method for penetrating 

target networks. With each new wave of attacks, the group has made quali-

tative changes to its toolkit and advanced to more sophisticated techniques 

for maintaining stealth. Since 2014, the group's arsenal has included the 

Dridex banking trojan, Neutrino botnet, and several families of ransomware, 

including Locky, Jaf, and GlobeImposter. Since spring 2018 the group has 

used the FlawedAmmyy remote access trojan, and since late 2018, the new 

ServHelper backdoor.
