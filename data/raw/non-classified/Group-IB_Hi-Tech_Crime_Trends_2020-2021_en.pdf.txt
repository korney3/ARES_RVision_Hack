HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

INTRODUCTION

As the world continues to be rocked 
by an unpredictable pandemic, with bor-
ders still closed, businesses struggling 
to stay afloat, and political confronta-
tions becoming increasingly hostile, 
one thing has remained constant:  The 
steady growth of cybercrime. 

For 17 years, Group-iB has dedicated 
its efforts to investigating cybercrime, 
monitoring the evolution of attackers’ 
tactics and instruments, and developing 
innovative technologies to hunt for and 
eliminate cyber threats. The company 
actively shares its insights and investi-
gations with the expert community and 
general public, and this expertise cul-
minates in the annual Group-iB Hi-Tech 
Crime Trends report.

in their new report, Hi-Tech Crime 
Trends 2020-2021, Group-iB experts 
name the key changes that have 
occurred in the field of high-tech crime, 
revealing the inner workings of the 
cybercrime underground, communica-
tion between different threat groups, 
and affiliate programs that sell mal-
ware and other malicious services. 
Traditionally, Group-iB investigates not 
only attacks on the commercial sector 
but also those on critical infrastructure. 
The latter are typically the result of cov-
ert activities conducted by the special 
services of various countries around the 
world.  

Hi-Tech Crime Trends gives you access 
to the most complete trove of strategic 
data and detailed information on active 
cyber threats. By reading the report, 
you will get the answer to these burning 
questions:

 — Who are your enemies 
in cyberspace? 

 — How do they operate today?

 — How will their toolkits adapt for 
future attacks? 

 — How can you protect yourself  
against them?

Armed with this knowledge, companies 
worldwide, regardless of industry, will 
be able to build more effective cyberse-
curity strategies.

The paralysis of entire economic 
sectors, mass transition to remote 
work, and widespread layoffs have led 
to a surge in cybercriminal activity. 
Threat actors have taken advantage 
of the unique global situation and 
become more creative, develop-
ing increasingly elaborate schemes 
to achieve their illicit goals. in the spring 
of 2020, Group-iB experts predicted 
that there would be a growth in the 
number of financial crimes, and cyber-
attacks on the computers, computer 
equipment (routers, web cameras), and 
unprotected networks of at-home work-
ers. Those employees working in finan-
cial institutions, telecom operators, 
and iT companies would be the primary 
targets. Unfortunately, the predictions 
were right. 

during the pandemic, Group-iB analysts 
noticed a spike in the number of cyber-
attacks originating from state-spon-
sored threat actors and criminals using 
spyware, ransomware, and backdoors 
to exploit people’s fears and anxiety 
over the coronavirus. The analysts also 
noted that attackers actively looked 
for ways get into enterprise networks, 
a goal they achieved by infecting the 
computers of remote workers with 
malware. 

While the overall number of success-
ful targeted attacks on banks went 
down, Group-iB analysts discovered 
a shocking increase in the use of social 
engineering to commit fraud. The main 
attack vectors are vishing and phishing, 
whose victims are mainly bank custom-
ers. The fraudsters’ main goal is still 
to steal money and information that can 
be sold, but they go about it in a new 
way. 

The past year saw the majority of cyber-
criminal groups switch to working with 
ransomware. With ransomware in their 
arsenal, attackers are able to earn 
no less than they would in a successful 
bank attack and with a much easier 
technical execution. Big Game Hunting, 
or attacking large companies with the 
aim of collecting the largest possible 
ransom, is gaining momentum. New 
groups are joining the game and creat-
ing dangerous affiliations and partner-
ships in the cybercrime underworld. 

The market for Cybercrime-as-a-service 
is actively developing. The phenome-
non directly correlates with the renting 
out of computer networks that are 
infected with malware (botnets) and 
used for organizing ddos attacks, 
sending phishing emails, and providing 
proxy servers. There have emerged new 
sellers of network access who form 
partnerships with ransomware opera-
tors and APT groups that have shifted 
their focus from bank theft to working 
with private affiliate programs. state-
sponsored threat actors have likewise 
jumped on bandwagon, opening the 
doors of corporate infrastructure to ran-
somware. This threat has become larger 
than life and can no longer be ignored 
by any company, no matter its industry 
or geographic location. 

We are confident that with the con-
stant exchange of information, joint 
efforts to maintain stability in the 
global cyberspace, and the creation and 
development of partnerships between 
private companies and international law 
enforcement agencies, we can effec-
tively combat cybercrime.  By raising 
the global community’s awareness 
of cybercrime, we can help preserve 
and protect the opportunities cyber-
space give us.

KEY FINDINGS 
AND FORECASTS



group-ib.com

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

page 8 of 78

Ransomware attacks

Current threats

Forecasts

The main goal:
create access to corporate networks  
for ransomware purposes

Ransomware affiliate 
programs shape the market of corporate 
network access for sale

 — Over the past year, seven new 
ransomware affiliate programs have 
emerged (bringing the total to 15), 
which has shaped the market of cor-
porate network access for sale.

 — Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the 
number of access for sale offers has 
increased 2.6-fold (from 138 to 362) 
compared to the previous period.

 — There are more and more users who 
actively sell access to corporate net-
works. in 2019, there were 50 active 
sellers; in the first half of 2020, 
Group-iB identified 63.

 — Owners of the banking botnets 
TrickBot, Qbot, silent Night, and RTM 
have started using their botnets 
to deploy ransomware.

 — The cybercriminal groups Cobalt 
and silence, which had previ-
ously focused on targeted attacks 
on banks, have presumably joined 
ransomware affiliate programs.

 — Primitive errors (such as vulnerable 
software versions in public services 
or weak passwords) pose one of the 
most serious risks to companies. 
if a vulnerable system is compro-
mised, adversaries will usually 
attempt to inflict as much damage 
to the business as possible, followed 
by extortion.

 — Ten ransomware affiliate programs 
involve brute-force attacks on serv-
ers accessible externally through 
Remote desktop services. Three pro-
grams exploit vulnerabilities in VPN 
services.

 — New botnets that perform distrib-
uted brute-force attacks on remote 
access interfaces (RdP, ssH, VPN) 
and other services have been 
identified.

 — One of the most common ways 
that victims are tricked into paying 
ransoms is stealing data from the 
network and threatening to leak the 
information online.

 — in an effort to increase their prof-
its, some groups have conducted 
auctions to sell stolen data instead 
of publishing it online.

 — Ransomware proved so popular that 
criminals began to publish ready-
made ransomware-as-a-service 
(Raas) projects for linux, MacOs, and 
Windows (e.g., the RAAsNet project) 
on websites such as GitHub. 

 — Cybercriminals have mainly used 
two post-exploitation frameworks 
to move laterally and gain control 
over targeted corporate networks: 
a free tool called Metasploit and 
a cracked version of Cobalt strike. 
less often, adversaries used the 
frameworks PoshC2 and Koadic. 
during the reporting period, 
Group-iB experts identified more 
than 10,000 hosts with these frame-
works installed. Between H2 2018 
and H1 2019, Group-iB researchers 
identified around 6,000 such hosts.

 — The countries attacked the most 
often were the UsA, the UK, Canada, 
France, and Germany. They suffered 
381 attacks out of 505, i.e. 75%.

 — The most attacked sector was manu-
facturing. Half of all attacks targeted 
entities in the manufacturing, trade, 
government, healthcare, construc-
tion, and academic sectors.

 — Group-iB identified cases of threat 
actors using new ransomware 
designed to disrupt processes 
associated with industrial net-
work applications. such tools help 
cybercriminals encrypt valuable 
data at manufacturing plants more 
effectively.

 — Group-iB expects that specialized 
trading platforms will emerge for 
exhibiting lots with access to cor-
porate networks, which may lead 
to even more related incidents.

 — We expect that there will be more 
demand for linux malware designed 
to achieve persistence in the network 
and escalate privileges.

 — ioT botnet owners may start selling 
access to devices installed on corpo-
rate networks.

 — New botnets and related criminal 
services for distributed brute-force 
attacks on remote control interfaces 
will emerge.

 — The number of ransomware affiliate 
programs will grow for a brief time 
only. Group-iB expects that the 
market will stabilize and that num-
bers will stop increasing by the end 
of 2020.

 — There may be cases of ransomware 
attacks targeting company mail sys-
tems. Hackers are likely to steal data 
from local mail servers and disable 
the mail system — bearing in mind 
that stable email communications 
are critical to businesses. This may 
lead to cloud mail services becoming 
more popular and the on-prem mail 
storage model being abandoned.

 — Groups that focus on attacks 

on sCAdA systems at industrial 
enterprises in order to manipulate 
production processes may emerge.

 — intelligence services may be inter-
ested in owners of affiliate programs 
and use them to access networks 
of interest.

 — To inflict maximum damage on enti-
ties and divert attention away from 
their attacks, special services may 
start mimicking criminals by spread-
ing documents that undermine the 
attacked organization’s business 
operations or by selling access to the 
affected corporate networks.

Military operations 

Current threats

Forecasts

More and more often 
espionage is replaced  
by active attempts
to destroy infrastructure facilities

High-profile attack  
targets include 
nuclear facilities in iran and india  
and israel's water supply system

 — intelligence agencies are attacking 
more aggressively. Their goal is now 
not only to spy on targets covertly 
but also destroy critical infrastruc-
ture facilities.

 — during the reporting period, seven 
new APT groups were identified. 
Group-iB also identified six known 
threat groups that had remained 
unnoticed for many years.

 — As part of an APT operation, adver-
saries shut down power units 
at nuclear power plants and phys-
ically destroyed the surrounding 
infrastructure.

 — A major cyberattack on a water 
management facility was thwarted. 

during the incident, threat actors 
attempted to poison water by alter-
ing water chlorine levels. Had it been 
successful, the civilian population 
in the country would have been seri-
ously affected.

 — some country leaders began openly 
announcing successful attacks 
on other countries.

 — Hacker arsenals were actively 
replenished with tools designed for 
attacks on air-gapped networks. Over 
the past year, four tools using UsB 
for bridging the air gap have been 
identified.

 — Against the backdrop of rising 
tension in the Middle East, attacks 
on the control systems of transport 
ships in the Persian Gulf may be car-
ried out.

 — Group-iB expects more sabotage 
operations against iran's critical 
infrastructure facilities, especially 

those related to nuclear energy.

 — security vendors have begun devel-
oping features for detecting back-
doors at the UEFi level more actively. 
such tools will help detect new UEFi 
malware leveraged during military 
operations.

 — New achievements made by Elon 
Musk's companies in the space 
industry may attract the attention 
of special services, both for espio-
nage purposes and in order to gain 
control over the control systems 
of his satellite internet constellation.

Threats to the telecommunications sector

Forecasts 

State-sponsored groups
show an interest in the telecom sector and 
conduct sophisticated attacks against it

2.3 Tb per second 
and 809 million packets  
per second
new records in ddos attack power

 — during the reporting period, six 
groups linked to special services 
actively attacked the telecommuni-
cations sector.

 — China is expanding its capacities 
in spying on mobile operators. To this 
end, it has developed a special Trojan 
for linux servers that intercepts sMs 
messages based on specific criteria.

 — Threat actors have set new records 
in ddos attack power: 2.3 Tb per 
second and 809 million packets per 
second.

 — 5G networks have not been widely 
deployed yet, which explains why the 
predictions relating to associated 
threats that we made in our previous 
report have not come true. They are 
relevant for the next period, however.

 — BGP hijacking and route leaks remain 
a serious problem. Over the past 
year, nine significant cases have 
been publicized.

 — As interstate conflicts continue 
to escalate, it is expected that threat 
actors will attack telecom operators 
for the first time in order to cause 
logical network congestion, which 
would lead to a cascading effect and 
affect multiple industries.

 — The COVid-19 pandemic has forced 
a significant number of people 
to work from home, and many 
of them will become permanent 
work-from-home employees after 
the pandemic ends. As such, the 
number of attacks on home routers 

and storage systems will con-
tinue to increase given that they 
help advanced crime groups and 
state-sponsored actors access 
corporate data without infiltrating 
an organization's perimeter.

Threats to the energy sector

Current threats

Forecasts 

Both state-sponsored groups 
and organized crime actors
disrupt facilities and encrypt data  
in order to demand ransoms

Air gap bypassed:
new tools for attacks on isolated  
networks discovered

 — Adversary arsenals were actively 
replenished with tools designed for 
attacks on air-gapped networks. 
Over the past year, four tools using 
UsB flash drives to bridge the air gap 
have been identified.

 — Nuclear power has become an obvi-
ous target for attackers. No such 
attacks were reported in the past 

year. in the reporting period, how-
ever, iran's nuclear energy facilities 
were sabotaged, while facilities 
in india were subject to espionage 
attacks. Threat actors are particularly 
interested in india because the coun-
try is developing nuclear technology 
and thorium-based reactors.

 — No new frameworks able to influence 
technological processes were iden-
tified in the reporting period, which 
suggests that threat actors have 
become more careful about conceal-
ing their use of such tools.

 — Organized crime groups have begun 
showing an active interest in energy 
companies. Targeted attacks are car-
ried out to seize control over entire 
networks and infect infrastructure 
with ransomware.

 — during the reported period, nine 
groups linked to intelligence services 
attacked the energy sector. seven 
hackers reportedly sold access 
to energy networks. in addition, 
eleven successful attacks involving 
ransomware were conducted on the 
sector in question.

 — Many types of ransomware have 
been equipped with new capabilities 
to detect processes associated with 
industrial control systems, which has 
led to substantial losses of critical 
data and increased ransom amounts 
for recovering access to such data. 
This is especially true for data stored 
on Historian servers.

 — Espionage will remain the primary 
goal of state-sponsored threat 
actors.

 — sabotage attacks on the energy sec-
tor will be carried out in the Middle 
East or in countries with emerging 
military conflicts.

 — To conduct attacks more effectively, 
threat actors will target not only 
large energy companies but also 

last-mile energy distributors and 
small suppliers that offer additional 
services to energy corporations.

 — 5G networks will connect a large 
number of devices to global net-
works, including those belonging 
to energy and industrial enterprises. 
As a result, the attack surface will 
increase dramatically.

 — Cybercriminals (mainly sophisticated 
hackers) will use the vector of initial 
infection through vulnerable network 
equipment more often. less skilled 
criminals will use common phishing 
techniques.

Threats to the banking sector

Current threats 

Forecasts

Targeted thefts are  
becoming rare cases
relevant only for poorly protected banks

Hackers gaining access  
and encrypting data  
to obtain hefty ransoms
is a trend in the banking sector

 — in 2020, there have so far been 
no public reports on thefts through 
sWiFT, ATM switch, payment 
gateways or ATMs when they were 
accessed through a bank’s network.

 — Nevertheless, the hacker group 
lazarus reportedly continued 
to carry out theft attempts through 
sWiFT. To gain initial access, the 

hackers used a banking botnet called 
Trickbot controlled by Russian-
speaking cybercriminals. Moreover, 
Group-iB researchers detected 
activity by another threat group 
that used publicly available Trojans, 
keyloggers, and unmodified exploits. 
such toolsets are effective only 
against banks with a minimum level 
of security. Alternatively, during inci-
dent response, security teams may 
have made mistakes that prevented 
them from identifying more sophisti-
cated tools.

 — in the second half of 2019, only the 
group silence carried out successful 
thefts without using sWiFT. They 
stopped attacking the financial sec-
tor in 2020, however.

 — The Philippine government-con-
trolled United Coconut Planters Bank 
(UCPB) was robbed in september 

2020. The threat actors gained 
access to the card processing sys-
tem and changed withdrawal limits. 
They also gained access to instaPay, 
an interbank transfer system. 
As a result, they siphoned 167 million 
pesos (Usd 3.44 million) from the 
bank.

 — Tools used for attacks on ATMs have 
evolved slightly. during the reporting 
period, the following utilities were 
identified: ATMdtrack developed 
by lazarus and a new version of the 
ATM Trojan developed by silence. 
it has not been confirmed whether 
either utility has been successfully 
used in thefts.

 — Cobalt and silence have presumably 
joined ransomware affiliate pro-
grams, but they have shifted their 
focus from banks.

 — Next year, there will probably 
be no traditional attacks on banks for 
theft purposes. There may be rare 
incidents, but this type of activity 
will no longer be as widespread 
as it used to be.

 — As with other sectors, ransomware 
operators will pose the biggest 
threat to the financial vertical. This 
hypothesis is confirmed by the 
increasing number of offers sell-
ing access to corporate networks 
belonging to financial institutions.

 — However, stealing information about 
financial transactions of ViP clients 
and publishing it online may become 
a more serious threat than data 
encryption. such attacks may cause 
significant financial damage and 
make banks pay ransoms to threat 
actors more readily.

 — disclosing financial transaction data 
could launch a series of investi-
gative journalism cases similar 
to the Panama Papers case in 2015 
(a massive exposure of confidential 

financial files belonging to Mossack 
Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm), 
in which some intelligence agencies 
are likely to be interested.

 — Another trend may be threat actors 
threatening to send (fake) alerts 
to financial regulators notifying 
that a bank has security issues. 
Threatening to send such notifi-
cations may act as an incentive 
for banks to pay higher amounts 
to extortionists.

Threats to retail

Current threats 

Forecasts

96 JS sniffer families
are currently being tracked  
by Group-iB experts

156% more bank card dumps
stolen using POs Trojans were offered  
for sale compared to the previous period

 — it is possible to single out four main 
threats targeting retailers that may 
damage businesses: Js sniffers, 
attacks on POs terminals, credential 
stuffing, and ransomware.

 — The number of known Js sniffer fam-
ilies has grown from 38 to 96 com-
pared to the previous year.

 — The state-sponsored threat 
group lazarus has started using 

Js sniffers. The threat actor uses 
a Js sniffer variant that automat-
ically steals funds from Bitcoin 
wallets.      

 — Techniques that prevent Js sniff-
ers from being detected on web 
resources have improved greatly.

 — The carding market has doubled 
from $880 million to $1.9 billion com-
pared to the previous year.

 — during the reporting period, 14 POs 
Trojans were found to be active. They 
were used to compromise and sell 
63.7 million bank card dumps, which 
is 156% more than in the previous 
year.

 — The amount of bank card textual 
details offered for sale has increased 
from 12.5 million to 28.3 million. The 
largest bank card data leaks are due 
to Us retailers being compromised. 

 — during the reporting period, 19 com-
promised retailer networks were 
identified, compared to 17 in the 
previous year.

 — scammers primarily targeted bank 
cards issued in the United states, 
which accounts for more than 92% 
of all card dumps, followed by india 
and south Korea.      

 — Although many vendors offer solu-
tions for protecting against bots and 
attacks such as credential stuffing, 
threat actors continue to actively 
use bots without browsers, which 
offers opportunities to create 
more advanced tools for bypassing 
defenses as well as possibilities 
to develop the cybercrime market 
in this direction.

 — Many online resources are hacked 
every day. Currently, the main mon-
etization methods used by hackers 
are selling databases and hosting 
phishing pages. However, damage 
to businesses may increase dras-
tically, and along with it the profits 
made by cybercriminals if the latter 
begin actively cooperating with ran-
somware developers.

 — Hacker groups using Js sniffers will 
pose a major threat to online retail-
ers, especially in the Us. At the same 
time, the main business risks will 
be associated with fines for security 
violations rather than with compen-
sation for damage to customers 
or reputational losses.

 — Attacks on computers with con-
nected POs terminals aimed at col-
lecting bank card dumps will remain 
a major threat in the United states.      

 — scammers often use a fraudu-
lent scheme as part of which they 
perform financial transactions 
in a given location, then use access 
to POs terminals to cancel the 
operations in other countries. The 
actions restore the card balance, 
and the cybercriminals can con-
tinue to perform fraudulent financial 
transactions. We may see similar 
new schemes involving access 
to online resources that accept card 
payments.

 — The carding market keeps growing. 
However, arrests of main players 
may stop this growth and redis-
tribute carding activity between 
criminals.

 — The main schemes for obtaining 
bank cards and the list of popu-
lar target countries are unlikely 
to change.

 — Carders may become more active 
in latin America, where there 
is a large community of hackers with 
experience in using financial Trojans.

Banking Trojans

Current threats 

Forecasts

19 PC Trojans and  
10 Android Trojans
have been active this year

Owners of banking botnets
are switching to ransomware

 — latin America, particularly Brazil, 
has become the main source of new 
banking Trojans.

 — Russian-speaking owners of the 
largest banking botnets (Trickbot, 
dridex, Qbot, and silent Night) have 
been following the main trend and 
switching to ransomware.

 — A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were 
active this year, 12 of which were 
written by Russian-speaking devel-
opers. six Trojans were developed 
by latin American authors. One tool 
could not be attributed.

 — in total, 10 Android banking Trojans 
were active this year. Five of them 
are brand new.

 — Russian-speaking owners of banking 
botnets for both PCs and Android 
devices will reduce their activity even 
further. Eventually, such botnets will 
cease to exist.

 — As banking Trojans become more 
active in latin America, some of their 

owners are likely to be arrested, 
which will also reduce this threat 
significantly.

 — Every year, three to five banking 
botnets for PCs disappear from the 
market. At this rate, the market for 
PC banking Trojans may become 

nonexistent in three to five years. 
A similar situation may occur with 
the market for Android Trojans, which 
are becoming less and less effective 
year after year.

Web phishing and social engineering

Current threats 

Forecasts

A 118% growth
in phishing compared to the previous year

New trend: 
using one-time links  
to phishing websites

 — Over the period investigated, 118% 
more phishing resources were 
identified and taken down compared 
to the previous reporting period.

 — The COVid-19 pandemic has 
encouraged more cybercriminals 

to become involved in phishing 
attacks, which is one of the key rea-
sons for the above-mentioned rise.      

 — Phishing attacks targeting bookmak-
ers increased in Q2 2020, amounting 
to 6% versus 2% in the previous 
quarter.

 — Another attack type that increased 
by 9% was phishing used to collect 
accounts for various online services 
such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, 
eBay, and Valve steam.

 — Phishing resources targeting crypto-
currency projects have disappeared 
almost completely.

 — so far, the main trend in 2020 is the 
use of one-time unique links that 
become inactive after the user 
opens them. This approach helps 
cybercriminals keep web phishing 
resources from being detected.

 — in Russia, the main reason for 
the significantly higher numbers 
of phishing attacks is the emer-
gence of various affiliate programs 
for hackers wanting to make money 
off phishing related to fake bank 
rewards programs, lottery draws, 
paid surveys, etc.

 — Phishing-as-a-service projects have 
become widespread in Russia.

 — Phishing affiliate programs that have 
become more popular in Russia 
will be more actively used in other 
regions.      

 — Phishing attacks have become 
automated and longer-lasting thanks 
to the emergence of scams prop-
agated through the Phishing-as-a-
service model. We expect that such 
projects will be actively developed 
and distributed.

 — One of the greatest challenges 
for the cybersecurity industry will 
be hackers using one-time web 
phishing links.

The emergence of ransomware affiliate programs

Going into 2019, many ransomware 
operators shifted their focus from ordi-
nary users to companies, government 
agencies, and other victims that would 
help them pocket more money. yet 
ransomware developers often lacked 
the tools and capabilities to infiltrate 
corporate networks. As a way to get 
around this problem, they began setting 
up affiliate programs. The scheme works 
as follows: threat actors who specialize 

in penetrating corporate networks 
monetize their actions by distributing 
ransomware. After the victim pays the 
ransom, the ransomware authors send 
a cut to their affiliates.

There are two types of affiliate pro-
grams: public and private. Public pro-
grams first emerged in mid-2019. Their 
distinctive feature is that the develop-
ers look for affiliates on underground 

forums. Private affiliate programs, 
on the other hand, are not advertised 
and are intended to bring together 
other types of threat actors (e.g. APT 
groups) and trusted users.

The table below contains information 
on affiliate programs related to the 
most popular ransomware.

Most often, the initial intrusion vec-
tor was a malicious email campaign, 
a brute-force attack against Remote 
desktop Protocol (RdP), or the exploita-
tion of public-facing applications 
(including VPN-related). 

in addition, other methods of distribut-
ing ransomware included exploit kits, 
VPNs, botnets, and other malware (e.g., 
downloaders). supply-chain attacks 
are extremely rare (the case of REvil). 
in general, the above delivery methods 
are also relevant for ransomware dis-
tributed without affiliate programs.

The table below contains information 
about ransomware affiliate programs 
and the initial compromise methods  
used by their operators.

Many affiliates prefer to keep their 
activities under the radar. However, ana-
lyzing their activity in the hacker com-
munity and information obtained during 

incident response procedures has made 
it possible to identify some of them. 
some users who showed an interest 
in affiliate programs on underground 

forums were involved in either selling 
access or working with various malware 
(including stealers). Examples of access 
are presented below.

Stealing and publishing data

in the early days, cybercriminals only 
encrypted data and demanded ransoms 
from victims. since the end of 2019, 
however, many have started using a new 
technique: before encrypting all the 
information, they copy it to their servers 
for further blackmailing. They usually 

use the HTTP, HTTPs, and FTPprotocols 
and legitimate cloud storage services. 
On rare occasions, they use email and 
instant messengers.

in such cases, if the victim fails to pay 
the ransom, then in addition to the data 

being stolen, the ransomware operators 
will publish them online. To do so they 
create special websites, usually in the 
Tor network. An example of such a web-
site is shown below.

Figure 3. stolen data goes online Figure 4. REvil auction

Attack statistics

Ransomware victims include both 
small local companies and interna-
tional giants. Over the last year, there 
have been reports of more than 500 
successful attacks using well-known 
ransomware on companies in more 
than 45 countries. The total number 

of successful attacks is much higher, 
but either the companies affected 
decided not to publicize the incident 
and pay the ransomware or the attack 
did not involve publishing data stolen 
from the victim's network. 

The most popular targets (about 60%) 
were Us companies. European coun-
tries accounted for only about 20% 
of all attacks. About 10% were countries 
in North and south America (excluding 
the UsA) and Asia (7%).

Once inside, many ransomware opera-
tors first attempt to escalate privileges 
by using exploits or post-exploitation 
frameworks. They then gain access 
to other accounts using various soft-
ware (e.g., Mimikatz, laZagne) or brute-
force attacks.

Threat actors then perform network 
reconnaissance using legitimate 
network scanners or frameworks such 
as Cobalt strike and Metasploit. They 
collect information about the system, 
groups, network resources, password 
policy, domain trust relationships, and 

more. The table below shows what 
frameworks were used by ransomware 
operators.

Maze and REvil have been the 
most active ransomware since 
late 2019, accounting for over 
50% of successful attacks. 
Ryuk, NetWalker, doppelPaymer 
are in the second tier.

The most often attacked 
sector was manufacturing. 
Half of all attacks targeted 
entities in the manufacturing, 
trade, government, healthcare, 
construction, and academic 
sectors. Although they currently 
focus on the above industries, 
affiliates usually seek easier 
targets, which explains the wide 
distribution of attacks across 
different verticals.

Estimated damage

Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish 
the exact damage caused by ran-
somware groups. This is because the 
amount should include the ransoms 
paid by victims, losses caused by sys-
tem downtime, and expenses of recov-
ering internal systems. in addition, 
it is difficult to obtain information about 
all attacks because many companies 
pay ransoms without making this fact 
public. 

What’s more, the amount often varies 
from company to company:

 — For example, the ransoms demanded 
by the group REvil depend on the 
size of the company and the number 
of infected hosts. if only one com-
puter on the network is infected, the 
ransom amount is about $48,000; 
but if several machines within the 
company's network are infected, 
then the average ransom amount 
is $470,000. There were several 
cases when the amount exceeded 
$1,000,000. The average ransom 
amounts to $260,000.

 — A group called Maze usually 
demands extremely high ransoms, 
i.e. beyond one million dollars. The 
average ransom is $2,420,000. 

 — some groups such as Wastedlocker 
carried out very few attacks, but 
the ransom amount exceeded 
$10 million. 

 — The same applies to MegaCortex 
ransomware. The exact number 
of attacks it has been involved 
in is unknown, but the ransoms 
reportedly vary from 20,000 
to $5,800,000.

The table below details past ransom amounts

This means that if combined publicly 
known attacks and experts estimations 
of possible ransomware incidents, the 
total potential damage could exceed 
one billion dollars ($1,005,186,000).

The data above only covers known inci-
dents and shows the lower end of the 
damage. it is just the tip of the iceberg. 
For example, only 62 incidents involv-
ing Ryuk and spread using the banking 
Trojan Trickbot have been reported.

According to Group-iB's statistics, how-
ever, the owners of the Trickbot botnet 
have successfully encrypted more than 
2,500 different networks over the past 
year using ransomware such as Ryuk 
(later Conti), Kraken, and Thanos. This 
means that the 62 known incidents rep-
resent only 2.5 percent of all incidents. 
The actual damage is likely to be much 
greater.

As regards dharma ransomware, its 
source code was put up for sale last 
year and could have been used by many 
groups. Given the circumstances, 
it is difficult to establish the damage 
caused.

Increasingly larger market for selling  
access to corporate networks

sales of credentials are widespread 
on underground forums and have taken 
place since the early days of such com-
munities. For a long time, cybercriminals 
did not perform additional reconnais-
sance after finding servers and gaining 
access to them, nor did they under-
stand that the compromised servers 

could belong to large companies and 
that access to them could be capital-
ized on. 

sales of corporate network access are 
increasing from year to year. The peak 
of sales occurred in 2020, which is asso-
ciated with an increase in the number 

of new ransomware affiliate programs. 
Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the num-
ber of access for sale offers increased 
2.6-fold (from 138 to 362) compared 
to the previous period.

were newcomers.

in H1 2020, 277 offers of access to corpo-
rate networks were put up for sale on under-
ground forums. The number of sellers 
has also grown. during the above period, 

63 sellers were active, and 52 of them 
began selling access in 2020. For com-
parison, during all of 2018, only 37 access 
sellers were active.

The market remains as fragmented as it was 
in 2019, and new sellers are replacing 
well-known  ones. The diagrams to the left

in 2019, cybercriminals stopped mentioning 
full company names when selling access, 
revealing only the country or industry. The 
full company name was indicated in only 
27% of ads.

As regards the targeted sectors, in 2019 
production companies remained the 
main victims. However, many healthcare 

organizations (usually hospitals and clinics) 
were also targeted.

in 2020, the list of attacked industries 
changed drastically. Various state-owned 
companies and educational institutions 
came to the fore. Manufacturing companies 
accounted for only 7.2%.

USA
 

The United states remains the most often 
attacked region. it is worth highlighting, 
however, that it has become increasingly 
difficult to establish the name and location 
of the companies to which access is being 
sold without communicating with the cyber-
criminals involved.

Nation-state actors sell access to networks  
and use ransomware

in an effort to increase their profits, 
some state-sponsored groups began 
selling access to corporate networks 
or even using ransomware like regular 
cybercriminals.

A perfect example is an ad published 
by a user with the nickname nanash 
in June 2020. The seller offered access 
to many networks, including some 
belonging to Us government depart-
ments, defense contractors (Airbus, 

Boeing, etc.), iT giants, and media com-
panies. The figure below contains the 
full text of the ad.

Although the message looks suspi-
cious, further investigation revealed 
that its author had access to at least 
two companies from the list above. 
Group-iB experts obtained screenshots 
and a video demonstration of ldAP 
access as evidence.

in the ad, the seller specifies that 
the price of access to each company 
is 11 BTC (Usd 125,000). Access is sold 
directly with partial prepayment: after 
the customer has transferred 5 BTC, the 
seller provides additional evidence and 
the second transaction occurs.

in the message, the author did not 
mention all the companies they have 
access to, but the cost of accesses 
to companies listed explicitly is close 
to $5 million.

Another way for state-sponsored 
groups to make money is to use 
ransomware:

 — Taiwanese authorities suspect 
that Chinese hackers from APT41 
were behind a ransomware attack 
on Taiwan's energy and technology 
companies in May 2020. The notice 
included CPC Corp., a Taiwanese 
company that delivers petroleum 
products throughout the island, 
among the victims. While the attack 
did not affect CPC's manufacturing 
processes, it prevented customers 
from using CPC Corp.'s payment 
cards to buy gas. during the wave 
of attacks on Taiwanese targets, 
threat actors used a new ransom-
ware called Coldlock. Malware 
analysis revealed similarities 
between the program and two known 
ransomware families: Freezing and 
EdA2, an open-source ransomware 
originally created for educational 
purposes.

 — The hacker group lazarus has 
resumed developing ransomware. 
The fact was brought to light during 
attacks on European companies 
involving ransomware called VHd 
Ransomware. The hackers gained 
access through a vulnerable VPN 
gateway, obtained administrator 
privileges, and installed the dacls 
backdoor. They moved across the 
victim's network and encrypted 
files with a combination of AEs-256 
in ECB mode and RsA-2048.

 — Another group of Chinese hackers, 
ironTiger, was behind the attack 
involving HybirdRansom ransomware 
against companies in the Asia-
Pacific region in the fall of 2019 and 
the spring of 2020. The ransomware 
has three components that conse-
quently launch each other to lock 
the machine and encrypt file: locker, 
loader, and Cryptor.

Large companies under increasing threat from massive hacks

Compromised hosts by time (2019-2020)

in the past, massive attacks did not 
cause serious damage to large com-
panies. This was because brute-force 
attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities 
in widespread software led to their 
infrastructure being used to distribute 
or manage malicious code, mine cryp-
tocurrencies, conduct ddos attacks, 
or proxy traffic.

However, the market for the sale 
of access to corporate networks, the 
number of ransomware attacks, and APT 
group activity have all increased, so the 
cost of an error on a company’s external 
perimeter has surged as well.

Ten out of 15 ransomware affiliate 
programs focus on brute-force attacks 
on RdP. Three programs actively exploit 

vulnerabilities in VPN services.

APT groups performed similar actions. 
For example, APT29 (aka Cozy Bear) 
actively exploited the following vulnera-
bilities with public exploits:

 — CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix)

 — CVE-2019-11510 (Pulse secure)

 — CVE-2018-13379 (FortiGate)

 — CVE-2019-9670 (Zimbra)

The APT group BlackEnergy (aka 
sandworm) exploited CVE-2019-10149 
(a vulnerability in the Exim mail server) 
to install an ssH backdoor.

Ordinary criminal groups carried 
out similar actions. For example, the 
group Clownz responsible for leaks 

from Godaddy and 247.ai also used 
CVE-2019-10149 (Exim) to install an ssH 
backdoor. For several months of activity, 
the group infected 80,000 servers.

As mentioned above, one of the main 
ways to gain access to corporate net-
works is to conduct brute-force attacks 
on remote access interfaces (RdP, ssH, 
VPN). How effective such an attack 
is will determine how many companies 
will be compromised as a result and how 
much money the fraudsters will make. 
Another key change is the emergence 
of new types of botnets. Their main 
purpose is to help perform distributed 
brute-force attacks from a large number 
of infected devices, including servers.

Brute-force botnet

After 1+ year of work, I want to announce a new 
distributed bruteforce/scanner.

Hey friends,

After one year of work, i'm happy to present a distributed 
brute-force scanner.

The distributed scanner/ bruteforcer is a software that 
distributes tasks to several computers to scan/brute-force 
simultaneously. This speeds up the process significantly.

 

Can the solutions be used on computers found?

yes, when using a module rootkit.

Growing activity of post-exploitation frameworks

Conducting a successful attack 
on a corporate network requires tools 
for lateral movement and privilege 
escalation. The growth of the access 
sales market has led to post-exploita-
tion frameworks being used more 
often. such frameworks are used 

by ransomware affiliates and oper-
ators, organized crime groups, and 
state-sponsored actors.

Group-iB regularly detects new infra-
structure for various post-exploitation 
frameworks. From H2 2019 to H1 2020, 

more than 10,000 hosts used by such 
frameworks were discovered. in con-
trast, 6,000 such hosts were discovered 
in the same period last year.

A changing threat landscape

Multiple attacks were carried out in the 
Asia-Pacific, a region in which the main 
active groups from China, North Korea, 
iran and Pakistan showed interest.

during the reporting period, seven 
new APT groups were discovered. 
Group-iB researchers also unveiled 
the activity of six known groups that 

remained unnoticed for the past few 
years.

→ MiliTARy OPERATiONs

The group Tortoiseshell has remained 
under the radar since July 2018. since 
then, it has attacked at least eleven 
iT companies, most of which are located 
in saudi Arabia.

in at least two organizations, evidence 
was found that attackers gained access 
at the domain administrator level, which 
resulted in several hundred computers 

on the network being compromised. 
it was probably a forced measure to find 
the device of greatest interest to them 
given that infecting an iT provider 
opens up opportunities to access client 
systems.

To achieve their goal, the group created 
a unique malware called Backdoor.
syskit, developed in versions in the 

delphi and .NET languages. With this 
backdoor in hand, the criminals were 
able to download and execute additional 
tools and commands. The malware was 
later identified in an attack involving 
a phishing website targeting Us military 
veterans.

The group Poison Carp has remained 
unnoticed since 2018. The threat actor 
is believed to have links to China due 
to the chosen attack targets: senior 
figures in Tibetan and Uyghur groups. 
Poison Carp uses eight Android browser 
exploits, one iOs exploit chain, and 
a spyware suite for Android and iOs.

Posing as journalists or officials, the 
hackers attacked high-profile officials 
by first contacting them via the mes-
saging service WhatsApp. After gaining 
their trust, the hackers sent the victims 
a link that installed spyware on the 
target devices.

Malicious software called MOONsHiNE 
helped the hackers obtain access 
to calls, messages (including mes-
sengers installed on the gadget), and 
geolocation data. it also allowed them 
to control the smartphone’s microphone 
and camera and install programs on the 
phone.

since 2016, the group Higaisa has 
remained unnoticed. The adversary 
carries out phishing campaigns, deliver-
ing executable files most often dis-
guised as legitimate installers, images 
or documents. Congratulatory texts 

or important news are used as decoys. 
The attackers use the following tools:

 — A modified version of GHOsT RAT

 — A keylogger

 — A malicious program designed 
to steal passwords from Outlook

 — Android Trojans (capable of taking 
screenshots, capturing GPs location 
and sMs messages, recording calls, 
stealing phone book data, and down-
loading files).

in the past, it was believed that hacker 
groups such as China-based APT10 
organized attacks on European multi-
nationals in the aerospace and defense 
industries. in fact, the threats came 
from previously unknown hackers 
such as AViVORE. The group has been 
active since 2015, but their activities 

peaked in 2019. AViVORE is reported 
to be behind recent attacks on Airbus, 
a European aerospace giant. Airbus 
was attacked four times in 2019, most 
recently in september.

The adversary infiltrated Airbus' global 
network of suppliers through the British 
engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, 

which supplies aircraft engines, and the 
French technology consultancy Expleo. 
in addition, two unidentified contractors 
working for the aerospace company 
were compromised. The main malicious 
tool used by the group is PlugX.

Although the group Nuo Chong lions 
was not active in 2019 and 2020, now 
that its leader has changed it is likely 
to become more active again. The group 
is also known as silencerlion, and its 
attacks from 2013 to 2018 were used 
to spy on and control critics of the 
saudi government at home and abroad. 
The group reportedly recruited two 
Twitter employees to gather confiden-
tial personal data about dissidents and 

radicals, including phone numbers and 
iP addresses. On November 11, 2015, 
Twitter issued a security notice to doz-
ens of account holders viewed by one 
of the former Twitter employees.

saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide 
to Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
salman, is suspected of being involved 
in the above. He also allegedly hired 
the israeli company NsO Group to spy 

on activists and journalists critical 
of Riyadh.

during their attacks, the hackers used 
watering hole and spear phishing meth-
ods. Nuo Chong lions employed four 
mobile RATs, including an open source 
tool called AndroRat and three com-
mercial RATs (sandroRat, spyNote, and 
MobiHok).

This hacker group attacked several 
Taiwanese semiconductor companies 
in 2018 and 2019. Experts named the 
threat actor Chimera. Their attacks were 
aimed at stealing as much intellectual 
property as possible, including doc-
uments on integrated circuits (iCs), 
software development kits, iC designs, 
and source code.

The motive behind the attacks is likely 
competitors (or possibly even nation-
states, given the advanced nature of the 
attacks) seeking to gain a competitive 
advantage. The networks were initially 
compromised through VPN servers and 
valid accounts were used. The hackers 
most likely obtained credentials for 
the VPN access from compromised 

accounts. The group is known for 
deploying a skeleton key malware that 
makes it possible to log in without valid 
credentials.

The group WildPressure does not 
overlap with other APT groups and uses 
new malware. The hackers attacked 
Middle Eastern organizations, with 
at least a few operating in the indus-
trial sector. The hackers distribute 

a fully-fledged C++ Trojan called Milum. 
inside the encrypted communica-
tions within the HTTP POsT requests, 
Group-iB researchers found the 
malware version 1.0.1. such a ver-
sion number indicates an early stage 

of development. Other fields suggest 
the existence of plans for non-C++ 
versions at the very least. This means 
that the group is likely to continue their 
attacks in the future.

Well-known groups remaining undetected for a long time 

The year was also marked by long-
term and covert attacks carried out 
by well-known groups that once seemed 
to have left the stage. On the one 
hand, this reaffirms that APT groups 
and their sophistication should never 
be underestimated. On the other hand, 
continuously training systems to detect 
malicious infrastructure and software 
at an early stage makes preventive 
measures much more effective, and 
means that more and more attacks can 
be tracked. Most such groups have their 
own unique style or use self-developed 
tools.

Golden Falcon

An unexpected discovery in 2019 was 
the activity of the group Golden Falcon 
(aka APT-C-34), which became known 
after one of the group's C&C servers 
was detected.

The group hacked private compa-
nies and government organizations 
in Kazakhstan. They mainly used two 
tools. The first was a version of RCs 
(Remote Control system), a surveil-
lance kit sold by an italian vendor called 
HackingTeam. The second was a back-
door named Harpoon that appears 

to have been developed by the group 
itself. documentation about the latter 
in Russian was found on a C&C server, 
which suggests that the group hired 
third-party developers to write the 
malware according to the group's own 
technical specifications.

The group's activities resemble those 
of the group dustsquad, which has 
been active since 2017. They also 
orchestrate espionage campaigns 
in Kazakhstan, for which they used 
the Octopus Trojan. The group may 
be backed by Kazakhstan's special

services or individuals interested 
in monitoring the situation in the 
country.

Naikon

The prize for the most stealthy and 
long-term campaign goes to the 
Chinese group Naikon for its five-year 
campaign against top government 
agencies in target countries in the 
APAC region. Naikon used a new back-
door called Aria-body that creates 
and deletes files and directories, takes 
screenshots, searches for files, and 
collects data (file metadata, system 
information, and location data). Even 
though the threat actor uses common 
initial intrusion vectors (emails with 
malicious attachments), their attacks 
are highly effective.

APT20    

For two years, the group APT20 
remained undetected while attacking 
companies and government agencies. 
The threat actor stole passwords and 
bypassed two-factor authentication 
to collect target data. Their large-scale 
campaign called Operation Wocao 
affected multiple industries including 
aviation, construction, finance, health-
care, insurance, gambling, and energy. 

The criminals effectively covered their 
tracks by regularly removing data-steal-
ing tools from infected computers.

APT5    

Another surprise comeback came from 
the group APT5 (aka Manganese). The 
group has been active since 2007 and 
consists of several subgroups with 
specific tactics and infrastructure. The 
criminals infiltrate organizations across 
various verticals. Their primary interest 
appears to be telecommunications and 
technology organizations, with a par-
ticular affinity for satellite communica-
tion firms.

during the reporting period, APT5 cre-
ated an infrastructure designed to scan 

the web for Fortinet and Pulse secure 
enterprise VPN servers. The criminals 
then exploited the CVE-2018-13379 
vulnerability in Fortinet and the CVE-
2019-11510 vulnerability in Pulse secure. 
These arbitrary file reading vulnerabil-
ities make it possible for an unauthen-
ticated remote attacker to read the con-
tent of files on vulnerable devices.

APT30    

it was uncovered that the group APT30 
has been upkeeping its 10-year-old 
tools (BACKsPACE and NETEAGlE) and 
has used them in attacks on southeast 
Asia. in addition, the hackers continued 
with their old approaches to organizing 
network resources and tested new soft-
ware: RHttpCtrl and RCtrl.

Cycldek    

The hacker group Cycldek also made 
an appearance. The threat actor 
uses the UsBCulprit Trojan, which 
is designed to steal data from corpo-
rate networks and helps gain access 
to disconnected and physically isolated 
devices. The malware had gone unde-
tected since 2014, with new samples 
appearing in 2019. The group focused 
on government organizations in several 
countries in southeast Asia.

Attacks on nuclear facilities    

India, 2019

in september 2019, Group-iB experts 
discovered an archive containing 
dtrack, a remote administration tool 
attributed to the North Korean group 
lazarus. Analysis revealed that the logs 
contained data from a compromised 
machine running Windows that belonged 
to an employee of the Nuclear Power 
Corporation of india limited (NPCil).

All the files in the archive were compiled 
at different times, but the main file with 
the compromised data is dated January 
30, 2019, i.e. more than six months before 
they were detected. This suggests that 
the hackers remained unnoticed in the 
victim’s network for a long time.

Analysis revealed that the attack against 
NPCil was taken even further and led 
to Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (sit-
uated in the south of the state of Tamil 
Nadu) being compromised. On October 
19, 2019, the power plant’s second power 
unit was shut down. Group-iB believes 
that these events may be linked.

According to the company officials, the 
reason for the power unit being shut 
down was a low sG level:

“The most important sG parameter 
subjected to regulation is the sG level. 
if the level is too low, the insufficient 
heat removal by the secondary side may 

cause evaporation of the reactor coolant, 
thus overheating of the reactor core.”

in other words, the pressure in the 
steam generator, which is responsible 
for transferring heat from the core to the 
generator's turbine, was low. This could 
have led to the core overheating.

After cybersecurity expert Puhraj singh 
tweeted about the attack, the nuclear 
power plant's administration released 
a statement in which singh's words were 
called “false information” and denied that 
an attack had occurred, stating that “any 
cyber-attack on the Nuclear Power Plant 
Control system is not possible.”

The Nuclear Power Corporation of india 
limited, however, later confirmed that 
the plant had been attacked. NPCil’s offi-
cial statement said that the malware 
infected one computer connected to the 
nuclear power plant’s administrative net-
work, but did not reach its critical internal 
network used to control the power 
plant's nuclear reactors.

South Korea, 2020

in April 2020, lazarus sent malicious 
emails to a company in the energy sector 
in south Korea. The hackers disguised 
themselves using a document with 
a description of a vacancy at KHNP 
(Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., ltd.). 

KHNP is a subsidiary of Korea Electric 
Power Corporation. it operates large 
nuclear and hydroelectric plants in south 
Korea, which supply about 30% of the 
country's electric power.

in addition, since October 2019, the North 
Korean groups lazarus and Kimsuky 
have been actively attacking south 
Korea's defense enterprises. The attacks 
have intensified since April 2020.

Iran, 2020

On July 3, 2020, it transpired that the 
israeli authorities were suspected of car-
rying out a cyberattack on iran's nuclear 
facilities. The incident occurred on July 
2 at iran's largest uranium-enrichment 
facility in Natanz and caused a fire 
and explosion. Before the incident was 
made public, a group calling itself the 
Homeland Cheetahs sent a statement 
to BBC Persian journalists and claimed 
to be behind the attack. The group alleg-
edly consists of "former members of the 
iranian security forces who have decided 
to fight against the authorities."

iran's officials said the incident had 
caused significant damage that could 
slow the development of advanced 
uranium enrichment centrifuges, but that 
there had been no casualties.

Attacks on Israel's water supply facilities

in April 2020, the israeli National Cyber-
directorate (iNCd) issued a security 
alert urging staff at companies in the 
energy and water sectors to change 
passwords for all internet-connected 
systems. According to the alert, the 
agency had received reports of intru-
sion attempts at wastewater treatment 
plants, water pumping stations, and 
sewers, which was confirmed by the 
israeli authorities. details of the attacks 
were not disclosed, but iNCd Head yigal 
Unn said they could have led to some 
damage to the civilian population and 
even temporary water shortages. israeli 
officials said that the attacks had 

targeted sCAdA systems of wastewater 
treatment facilities, but that they had 
been successfully thwarted.

initial reports played down the April 
attack, but a Financial Times report 
a few month later cited its sources 
as claiming that the hackers had gained 
access to some of israel's water treat-
ment systems and tried altering water 
chlorine levels before being detected 
and stopped. if the sabotage attack had 
been successful, attackers could have 
poisoned the local population served 
by the treatment facility affected.

in addition, the israeli Water Authority 
warned that in June 2020 water 

supply and water treatment systems 
were attacked again. The incidents 
reportedly did not cause any damage 
to israel’s water system.

The first attack affected agricultural 
water pumps in upper Galilee, while 
the second one targeted water pumps 
in the central province of Mateh yehuda, 
local media reported. 

"These were specific, small drainage 
installations in the agriculture sec-
tor that were immediately and inde-
pendently repaired by the locals, caus-
ing no harm or any real-world effects," 
the Water Authority said in a statement.

Attacks on Iran’s critical facilities

On May 9, 2020, hackers carried 
out a cyberattack on the sys-
tems of iran’s shahid Rajaee port 
in the city of Bandar Abbas. According 
to iran's Ministry of Roads and Urban 
development officials, the attack 
affected a limited number of private 
operating resources in the port and did 
not cause significant damage. 

it was later revealed, however, that com-
puters regulating the flow of vessels, 
trucks, and goods all crashed at the 
same time, creating massive backups 
on waterways and roads leading to the 
facility.

The attack was presumably in response 
to an alleged iranian attempt to hack 
into israel’s water infrastructure 
systems.

The attack was followed by a series 
of accidents and explosions at some 
of iran’s critical facilities, including pet-
rochemical plants, uranium enrichment 
facilities, power plants, and ports.

On June 26, a large explosion occurred 
near Tehran region. The iranian govern-
ment was quick to dismiss the epi-
sode as a gas explosion at the Parchin 
military base. satellite photographs, 
however, revealed that the explosion 
happened at the Khodjir missile produc-
tion facility (part of the shahid Hemmat 

industrial Group). The base is laced with 
underground tunnels and has long been 
suspected of being a major site for 
iran’s growing arsenal.

iran linked the attack to a power outage 
in the city of shiraz, nearly 600 miles 
to the south. shiraz also has major mili-
tary facilities, and the explosion and the 

outage happened almost at the same 
time. American and israeli intelligence 
officials insist they were not involved.

APT41

The hacker group APT41 carried 
out a number of attacks recently. 
in February 2020, the hackers success-
fully exploited a Cisco RV320 router 
at a telecommunications organization. 
it is unknown what specific exploit was 
used, but there is a Metasploit module 
that combines CVE-2019-1653 and 
CVE-2019-1652 to enable remote code 
execution on such routers. it also uses 
wget to download specified payloads.

APT41 also exploited the CVE-
2020-10189 vulnerability in Zoho 
ManageEngine, which allows unauthen-
ticated remote attackers to execute 
arbitrary code with sysTEM/root priv-
ileges. The day after CVE-2020-10189 
was fixed, the threat actors attacked 
over a dozen systems and compromised 
at least five. They then deployed a trial 
version of the Cobalt strike BEACON 
loader and used another backdoor 
to download VMProtected Meterpreter.

OilRig

The iranian group OilRig has been 
directly involved in two campaigns 
affecting the telecommunications 
sector.

One of the campaigns lasted three 
years and was dubbed Fox Kitten 
by security researchers. during the 
campaign, the threat actors gained 
access to and ensured persistence 
in the networks belonging to numer-
ous companies and organizations 
from various sectors, including 
telecommunications.

in most cases, target organizations 
were initially infected through one-day 
vulnerabilities in various VPN services 
such as Pulse secure VPN, Fortinet 
VPN, and Palo Alto Networks’ Global 
Protect. Once inside the company, 
the attackers would try to maintain 
access to networks by opening a variety 
of communication tools, including open-
ing RdP links over ssH tunneling. At the 
final stage, after successfully infiltrating 

the organization, the attackers per-
formed the routine process of identify-
ing, examining and filtering sensitive val-
uable information from every targeted 
organization.

The second campaign affected telecom 
providers in south Asia and was discov-
ered in April 2020. during the campaign, 
the threat actors used post-exploitation 
frameworks and tools such as Covenant, 
Cobalt strike, Metasploit, and Mimikatz. 
in addition, the group used legiti-
mate tools such as Plink, Bitvise, and 
Bitsadmin. The threat actors used 
phishing emails to gain initial access. 
The campaign’s main aim was to steal 
user credentials and gain access 
to database servers using the obtained 
credentials.

The attacks were long-term: the 
threat actors may have infiltrated the 
network of one organization as early 
as in October 2019. The first activity 
was detected on October 11, 2019, 
when a malicious Powershell command 
was executed to install a Cobalt strike 
Beacon module. The threat actors then 
executed a Powershell command that 
launched Metasploit for achieving per-
sistence in the system.

The group’s activities resumed 
on February 6, 2020, when a Powershell 
command was executed to search for 
files similar to web.config. For each 
file found, the threat actors extracted 
username and password details where 
possible. They may use the credentials 
to access organizational resources such 
as sQl servers. 

On March 11, the threat actor attempted 
to connect to a database server via 
Powershell, presumably using stolen 
credentials. The hackers also used 
an sQl command to obtain informa-
tion about the database server ver-
sion, possibly to verify credentials and 
connectivity.

Molerats

Between October 2019 and early 
december 2019, security researchers 
identified multiple instances of phishing 

attacks likely related to a threat group 
called Molerats (also known as Gaza 
Hackers Team and Gaza Cybergang). 
The group targeted organizations in the 
telecommunications, insurance, and 
retail industries and government agen-
cies, eight in total, all in six countries.

All the attacks involved spear-phish-
ing emails with malicious documents 
that required the recipient to carry out 
certain actions. The social engineering 
techniques involved misleading images 
that tricked users into enabling content 
to run macros. The hackers also threat-
ened to release compromising pictures 
to the media as a way of coercing users 
into clicking a link and downloading 
malicious payloads. during most such 
attacks, the payload was a backdoor 
called spark, which allows threat actors 
to open applications and run command 
line commands on the compromised 
system.

Mikroceen

security experts analyzed a Trojan 
used by an unknown Chinese APT that 
spied on undisclosed companies in the 
telecommunications and gas indus-
tries as well as a government entity 
in Central Asia. The analysts called this 
campaign Mikroceen.

As part of their operations, the threat 
group used backdoors to gain per-
manent access to corporate net-
works. Based on the data obtained, 
Group-iB researchers believe that 
the same group was involved in other 
attacks, including Microcin against 
Russian military personnel, ByEBy 
against the Belarussian govern-
ment, and Vicious Panda against the 
Mongolian public sector. The group has 
been active since at least 2017.

The experts justify this theory by the 
fact that the hackers used Gh0st RAT, 
which has been used by Chinese APTs 
often and for a long time. in addition, 
the analysts discovered clear similari-
ties in the malware codes.

Attacks on mobile operators

APT41, a Chinese state-sponsored 
threat group, was highly active during 
the investigated period. The group 
actively deployed malware called 
MEssAGETAP. 

The malware is designed for linux 
devices and meant to be installed 
on short Message service Center 
(sMsC) servers located inside mobile 
operator networks that handle sMs 
communications. After compromising 
a cluster of linux servers belonging 
to an unidentified telecom provider, 
the group would intercept messages 

sent by individuals of interest to the 
Chinese government. The criminals then 
searched for messages based on the 
keyword list containing items of geopo-
litical interest for Chinese intelligence 
services. sanitized examples include the 
names of political leaders, military and 
intelligence organizations, and political 
movements at odds with the Chinese 
government.

MEssAGETAP also sets aside sMs 
messages if they are sent from 
or to particular phone numbers, 
or from or to a device with a particular 

international Mobile subscriber identity 
(iMsi) unique identifier. When it was 
discovered, the malware was tracking 
thousands of device phone numbers 
and iMsi codes at a time.

during attacks, the threat actor also 
interacted with call detail record (CdR) 
databases to query, save, and steal 
records about individuals of interest. 
Targeting CdR information provides 
a high-level overview of phone calls 
between individuals, including time, 
duration, and phone numbers.

→ THREATs TO THE TElECOMMUNiCATiONs sECTOR

MEssAGETAP is a 64-bit ElF data miner 
initially loaded by an installation script. 
Once installed, the malware checks 
for two files: keyword_parm.txt and 
parm.txt, which contain instructions 
for MEssAGETAP to target and save 
sMs message content. Both files are 
deleted from the disk once the config-
uration files are read and loaded into 
the memory. After loading the keyword 

and phone data files, MEssAGETAP 
begins monitoring all network connec-
tions to and from the server. it uses 
the libpcap library to listen to all traffic 
and extracts sMs message metadata, 
including sMs message content, iMsi 
numbers, and source and destination 
phone numbers.

Based on the above information, users 
and organizations must consider 
the risk of unencrypted data being 
intercepted several layers upstream 
in their cellular communication chain. 
This is especially critical for frequently 
targeted individuals such as dissidents, 
journalists, and officials who handle 
highly sensitive information. 

BGP Hijacking

BGP hijacking remains a serious problem. Attacks and delib-
erate interruptions often occur because companies fail to cor-
rectly set configurations or prefix filters.

An increase in the number of internet 
of Things (ioT) devices has led to more 
and more hosts being added to infa-
mous botnets such as Mirai. in addition, 
new botnets have emerged.

As regards ddos attack techniques, 
syN floods still remain the most 
common type of attack. iCMP flood 
attacks rose from last to second place 
in popularity, and HTTP floods finished 
in last place — they have become less 
widespread since January 2019.

in 2020, denial-of-service attacks 
became more effective. in the first half 
of 2020, threat actors set new records 
for ddos attack power.

Largest Gbps DDoS attack ever 
recorded

According to Amazon's Q1 2020 threat 
report, its AWs shield service miti-
gated the largest ddos attack ever 
recorded, stopping a 2.3 Tbps attack 
in mid-February this year. The company 
did not disclose the attack’s target 
or origin. The attack was carried out 
using hijacked CldAP web servers and 
lasted three days. CldAP (Connection-
less lightweight directory Access 
Protocol) is an alternative to the older 
ldAP protocol that has been abused for 
ddos attacks since 2016. CldAP serv-
ers are known to amplify ddos traffic 

by 56 to 70 times its initial size, making 
it a highly sought-after protocol and 
a common option provided by ddos-
for-hire services.

The previous record for the larg-
est ddos attack ever recorded was 
1.7 Tbps. it was mitigated by NETsCOUT 
Arbor in March 2018. The attack 
abused Memcached servers exposed 
to the internet and reached massive 
bandwidths.

Largest Mpps DDoS attack

A bank in Europe was hit by a massive, 
distributed denial-of-service (ddos) 
attack that generated a record 809 
million packets per second (PPs). The 
record ddos attack was mitigated 
by Akamai on June 21, 2020. The com-
pany did not disclose the bank’s name.

it was unusual that 96.2% of the 
iP addresses involved in the attacks 
were not being tracked as recent 
attacks, which suggests that a new 

botnet emerged. The June 21 attack was 
remarkable not only for its size, but also 
because of how quickly it reached its 
peak. The attack grew from normal traf-
fic levels to 418 Gbps in seconds before 
reaching its peak size of 809 Mpps 
in approximately two minutes. in total, 
the attack lasted just under 10 minutes.   

Nation-level accessibility issues

in early February 2020, iran's infrastruc-
ture came under a large-scale ddos 

attack, which left 25% of users in iran 
without internet. The NetBlocks internet 
observatory, which maps internet secu-
rity and freedom in real-time, confirmed 
that there was extensive disruption 
to the iranian telecommunications 
network that began on the morning 
of February 8 at 11:45 local time.

The consequences of the massive ddos 
attack left the country’s major network 
operators unable to operate for one 
to seven hours.

THREATS TO THE 
ENERGY SECTOR

it has been a challenging year for 
the energy sector. The most notable 
threats occurred in the nuclear power 
industry. For more details, please refer 
to the "Military Operations" section 
of this report. As part of their opera-
tions, adversaries shut down power 
units at nuclear power plants and 
physically destroyed the surrounding 
infrastructure.

in the reporting period, iran's nuclear 
energy facilities were sabotaged, while 
facilities in india were subject to espio-
nage attacks. Threat actors are par-
ticularly interested in india because the 
country is developing nuclear technol-
ogy and thorium-based reactors.      

Apart from special services, organized 
crime groups also began to pose a seri-
ous threat to energy companies. Both 
can disrupt production using ransom-
ware to obtain a ransom.

APT20

The Chinese-backed hacker group 
APT20 attacked companies in ten 
countries as part of a campaign called 
Operation Wocao. The group’s attacks 
affected various industries, including 
the energy sector.

The hackers compromised target 
networks via vulnerable web servers 
managed by a company or government 
entity. The threat actor then propagated 
across the network looking for system 
administrator credentials with privileged 
access to the infrastructure's most 
critical parts.

APT20 installed keyloggers on com-
puters used by administrators in order 
to capture keystrokes and steal pass-
words. The campaign involved tools 
such as web shells for file upload and 
command execution, a script for scan-
ning the system for information, the 
custom Xserver backdoor, CheckAdmin 
to identify if administrators are logged 
in, and others.

APT28

The group APT28 is believed to have 
been behind a phishing attack against 
the Ukrainian oil and gas group com-
pany Burisma in early November 2019.  

The threat actors registered lookalike 
domains that mimicked legitimate web-
sites belonging to Burisma’s subsidiar-
ies and partners. in particular, domains 
targeting the following subsidiaries 
were discovered: KUB-Gas llC, Esko-
Pivnich, and CUB Energy inc. 

To carry out the attack, the threat 
actors sent employees emails with 
links to login pages. The links looked 
legitimate. in addition, the attackers 
set up sender authentication records 
using sPF and dKiM. After victims 
followed the link and entered their cre-
dentials, the attackers gained access 
to them and could use them to further 
the attack. some employees entered 
their credentials on the fake web-
pages, which allowed the threat actors 
to stealthily operate within the organi-
zation and obtain the information they 
needed.

APT41

The group APT41 used a new ransom-
ware family called Coldlock to conduct 
a series of attacks against several 
organizations in Taiwan. Analysis of the 
malware revealed similarities between 
Coldlock and the previously known 
Freezing ransomware family as well 
as the EdA2 “educational” ransomware 
kit. For example, Freezing and Coldlock 
have a similar method of propagat-
ing within networks (compromised 
Ad servers), similar reflective injection 
methods, and a similar internal module 
architecture.

Coldlock terminates the following ser-
vices on the system before encrypting 
their files:

 — mariadb      

 — msexchangeis      

 — mssql      

 — mysql      

 — oracleservice

it also terminates the Outlook pro-
cess and checks the Windows version 
running on the system. if the system 
is running Windows 10, the ransomware 
carries out several Windows 10-specific 
routines. Windows defender is disa-
bled, as is the ability to send feedback/
malware samples to Microsoft. Push 
notifications are disabled as well.

According to media reports, the 
campaign struck the computer sys-
tems of Taiwan’s state-owned energy 
company, CPC Corp., which delivers oil 
products throughout Taiwan. Although 
the attack did not affect the compa-
ny’s energy production, it did reportedly 
prevent some customers from using 
CPC Corp.’s payment cards to purchase 
gas.

PoetRAT

A new remote access Trojan 
named PoetRAT was discovered 
in February 2020. The attacks affected 
Azerbaijan’s government agencies 
and industrial companies, mainly 
in the energy sector. The investigation 
revealed that cybercriminals are par-
ticularly interested in sCAdA systems 
used in the electricity sector, specifi-
cally in wind turbine systems.

RAT is written in Python and has all the 
features specific to this type of mal-
ware. it gives the operators complete 
control over the compromised system.

The attackers sent malicious Microsoft 
Word documents, some of which were 
made to look like messages from 
Azerbaijani government agencies 
or from the defense Research and 
development Organization of india. 
some of the file names mentioned 
COVid-19.

The threat actors monitored specific 
directories, which meant that they 
wanted to exfiltrate specific informa-
tion about the victims. The attackers 
likely wanted to get a full picture of the 
victims by using keyloggers, browser 
credential stealers, and Mimikatz 
and pypykatz for further credential 
harvesting.

OilRig

iranian hackers were once again found 
to be using wipers, but this time the 
attacks are attributed to the OilRig 
group (aka APT34). A new Trojan called 
ZeroCleare was used in a recently 
discovered targeted attack on an oil and 
gas company.

The attack most likely started in the fall 
of 2018 with reconnaissance scanning 
from various low-cost/free VPN provid-
ers and gaining access to one of the 
accounts that was later involved in the 

attack. during the summer of 2019, the 
attackers used a password spray from 
a system on the local network to gain 
access to additional accounts, install 
AsPX web shells, and gain domain 
administration privileges.

After the device was compromised 
through a vulnerable driver, the wiper 
spread to other devices in the network 
for further destructive attacks. The 
malware then overwrote the master 
boot record (MBR) and disk partitions 
on Windows-based machines using 
a legitimate driver, Eldos Rawdisk. While 
Group-iB researchers could not deter-
mine the exact number of organizations 
that were impacted, at least 1,400 hosts 
were affected by ZeroCleare.

later, a new strain of ZeroCleare 
data-wiping malware called dustman 
was detected on the network belonging 
to Bapco, Bahrain's national oil com-
pany. A common component of the 
malware is Eldos Rawdisk. dustman 
differs from other wipers by the fact 
that the necessary drivers and loaders 
are supplied in one executable file and 
not two, as is the case with ZeroCleare. 
dustman also overwrites the volume, 
while ZeroCleare erases it by overwrit-
ing it with junk data (0x55).

in this case, however, OilRig was most 
likely trying to cover its tracks as the 
hackers had previously made mistakes 
that revealed their presence on the 
network.

Orangeworm

since January 2020, a wave of attacks 
involving the Kwampirs Trojan has been 
identified. The malware has been linked 
to the Orangeworm group, which used 
the Trojan to attack companies in the 
healthcare sector, in particular software 
supply chain companies.

After penetrating the system, Kwampirs 
collects basic data about the device and 
sends it to a remote server. Attackers 
then gain access to sensitive data using 
the backdoor on the infected machine. 
if the compromised system is identi-
fied as potentially interesting, the data 
is stolen and the malware is copied 
to all available machines and network 
resources.

This year, the threat actor has been 
conducting supply-chain attacks 
against software vendors, but the 
group's ultimate interest has changed. 
They now attempt to gain access 
to organizations that support industrial 
control systems (iCs) for the global pro-
duction, transmission, and distribution 
of energy.

Orangeworm is not officially associ-
ated with any country. The FBi has said, 
however, that the Kwampirs source 
code shows that the Trojan is simi-
lar to the infamous shamoon wiper 
developed by the iranian hacker APT33, 
though the latter does not have a wiper 
component.

Many industrial networks are “air 
gapped” and to some extent isolated 
from other internal networks. But even 
protected networks can be breached.

Attackers most often use the following 
methods to bypass air gaps:

 — Trusted UsB devices      

 — Connected Raspberry Pi devices    

 — supply-chain attacks  

during the reporting period, new tools 
for jumping the air gap emerged:

Once it is in the system, UsBCulprit scans paths to executable 
files, collects documents with certain extensions, and exports them 
to UsB drives connected to the system.

When a UsB drive infected with UsBCulprit is connected 
to a computer, the Trojan will copy stolen files either to or from the 
removable drive.

Tropic Trooper (China) UsB worm 
UsBferry

The threat actors ferry a malware installer via UsB into an air-gapped 
host.

The malware checks for network connectivity. if it determines that the 
network is unavailable, it tries to collect information from the target 
machine and copy the collected data to UsB storage. 

After that, the Trojan exfiltrates information and uploads it to the 
C&C server.

(end of March 2020)

All versions of the malware differ from each other and infect victims 
in different ways. Versions 1 and 2.b exploit a vulnerability in .doc 
(CVE-2017-0199), .rtf (CVE-2017-11882), and Visual Basic mechanisms 
integrated into Word. Version 2.a is disguised as a 7zip installer.

The persistence mechanism is selected based on the Ramsay version 
used. some have a special spreader component that copies Ramsay 
to all PE files located on disks, including removable drives, in order 
to eventually reach isolated systems.

The threat actor exfiltrates the collected data using an external 
component that has not yet been detected.

Turla COMpfun The hackers have updated the classic COMpfun remote access Trojan 
by adding the ability to check whether a UsB drive is connected 
to the infected host. security experts believe that this mechanism 
is used by Turla to infect physically isolated systems and spread the 
Trojan automatically.

Transparent Tribe UsBWorm component  
of the Crimson Trojan

UsBWorm is a component developed for stealing files from 
removable drives and spreading malware across systems by infecting 
removable media. To steal data, the malware enumerates all the files 
stored on the device and copies those with an extension matching 
a predefined list.

As part of the infection process, the malware lists all directories. 

Then, for each directory, it creates a copy of itself in the drive root 
directory using the same directory name and changing the directory 
attribute to “hidden”. 

This results in all the actual directories being hidden and replaced 
with a copy of the malware using the same directory name. Moreover, 
UsBWorm uses an icon that mimics a Windows directory, tricking the 
user into executing the malware when trying to access a directory.

Crime groups conduct two main types 
of attack on the energy sector:

 — Active sale of access, including 
to networks belonging to energy 
companies

 — Ransomware attacks     

Many types of ransomware have been 
equipped with new capabilities to detect 
processes associated with industrial 
control systems. This has caused 

substantial losses of critical data and 
higher ransom amounts for recover-
ing access to such data. This is espe-
cially true for data stored on Historian 
servers.

in 2019, cybercriminals stopped publish 
full company names very often, making 
it more difficult to categorize a compro-
mised company. Based on the descrip-
tions presented, six companies in the 
energy sector were identified. Five 

of them are associated with the extrac-
tion of energy resources.

in 2020, Group-iB did not observe 
an increase in the sale of access to net-
works belonging to energy companies. 
This year, access to seven companies 

was offered for sale. Two companies 
are involved with energy directly and 
five are associated with production. The 
only company whose name has been 
published is Entrust Energy.

Organized crime targeting the energy sector

Attack vector Modus operandi

Reconnaissance via OPC Attackers use the OPC protocol to gather information about the equipment being  
used and to identify its topology.

Access to sCAdA HMi since HMi workstations have a small attack surface, in addition to standard methods of gaining access 
to computers running Windows, hackers actively investigate vulnerabilities in the HMi. Exploiting such 
vulnerabilities means that malicious code can be executed.

Controller management Attack frameworks (e.g., idustroyer) are being supplemented with modules that allow threat actors 
to manage controllers using standard protocols such as iEC 60870-5-101, iEC 60870-5-104, and iEC 61850.

Control over emergency 
shutdown systems

Control over emergency shutdown systems allows hackers to stop production, so attackers have 
developed specialized modules for this purpose (e.g., the Triton framework).

infiltration through home 
routers and NAs

in order to detect industrial networks, the threat actors load modules for traffic analysis and Modbus 
protocol detection (e.g., the VPNFilter framework) on network devices.

Over the past year, eleven attacks 
against energy companies have 
been detected. Five of the targeted 

companies are linked to energy directly 
and six are related to production. At the 
same time, there is no specific type 

of ransomware used in this industry: the 
attacks involved eight different ransom-
ware families.

THREATS TO THE 
BANKING SECTOR

The era of targeted attacks on banks 
to steal funds is over. last year's report 
covered five active groups: Cobalt, 
MoneyTaker, silence, silentCards, 
and lazarus, all of which successfully 
committed thefts through sWiFT, ATM 
switch, card processing, and ATMs. 
in 2020, such thefts have almost 
stopped.

SWIFT

Recent thefts

Only lazarus and Cobalt stole via 
sWiFT. The most recent public incident 
occurred in February 2019 at the Bank 
of Valletta in Malta.

The most interesting events always 
remain behind the scenes, however, 
and attempts to commit theft have not 

stopped entirely. Over the past year, 
Group-iB researchers detected inci-
dents in several countries (Argentina, 
india, Kenya, Ghana, and Jordan) per 
quarter, but not all attempts were suc-
cessful. Two groups were active during 
this period: Nanoswift and lazarus.

NanoSwift

At least one known incident involving 
this group took place. Compromise 
was initially achieved using a legitimate 
remote access tool called RMs, which 
was installed using a VBs script:

Tool Description

invoke-Ms16135.ps1 A privilege escalation exploit that is a part of Powershell Empire

2696ee4302a85c6b4101fc6d1ce8e38b94fd9c2bbd1acc73b553576b3aacb92f

Evidence suggests that the threat actor 
uses quite an old toolset. it is effective 
only if the hackers attack a bank with 
a minimum level of security and set 
“traps” for the incident response teams.

What is notable, however, is the use 
of CVE-2020-0796, which was made 
public in March 2020, and the first 
exploit was made available in the same 
month. A file named cve-2020-0796-lo-
cal.zip was published on GitHub on April 
3. This indicates that the incident took 
place between April and July 2020.

Lazarus

lazarus mainly attacks small banks 
because they are an easy target.

in 2020, it transpired that the group 
purchases pay-per-install services from 
operators of the TrickBot botnet. This 
explains why, in the case of several 
incidents, it was noted that the TrickBot 
Trojan loaded into  the memory mali-
cious code developed by lazarus, which 
was downloaded from external servers. 
The incidents involved two domains 
used by lazarus from which malicious 
code was downloaded:

 — util98[.]com, registered on April 
24, 2019

 — startmary[.]com, registered 
on January 13, 2020

Based on the dates when the domains 
were registered, the organizations were 
compromised in April 2019 and January 
2020, but the thefts were attempted 
one to two months later.

This script has been “in the wild” for 
a long time and was first uploaded 
to VirusTotal on October 8, 2018.

For further propagation, the attack-
ers used the well-known NanoCore 
Trojan, which was saved on the system 
as lanss.exe in the \lAN subsystem\
lanss.exe directory, which is a typical 
NanoCore indicator known since 2018.

The following tools were used to esca-
late privileges:

Card processing

in the past, the groups Cobalt, 
MoneyTaker, and silence were reported 
to attack card processing systems. 
However, recent attacks of this type 
were carried out by silence only, in the 
first half of 2019.

The Philippine government-controlled 
United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) 
was robbed in september 2020. The 
reports mentioned that the attackers 
increased the ATM withdrawal limit from 
20,000 pesos to 10 million pesos per 
day. 

They also gained access to instaPay, 
an interbank transfer system. 
As a result, they siphoned 167 million 
pesos (Usd 3.44 million) from the bank.

Following the investigation, four 
Nigerian citizens were arrested.

ATM Switch

ATM

The only group that leveraged ATM 
switch access during the reporting 
period is lazarus. in August 2020, 
Us-CERT issued a security alert that 

this group had resumed its activity and 
that they had malicious code in their 
arsenal that could be used to steal 
funds through an ATM switch running 

Windows. in the past, this code was 
used only to attack AiX operating 
system versions. despite the alert, the 
most recent theft was detected in 2018.

Many groups (Cobalt, MoneyTaker, 
silence, lazarus) possess ATM Trojans, 
but they don't actively use these tools.

in september 2019, Group-iB research-
ers described a Trojan called dtrack 
used by lazarus, which was discovered 
back in 2018. since then, it has not been 
used for theft purposes.

in the second half of 2019, silence was 
the only group to carry out attacks 
on banks. They successfully infiltrated 
several banks in Chile, Costa Rica, 
and Bulgaria, but their attacks were 
thwarted at early stages.

in November 2019, two files were 
uploaded to VirusTotal from the 
Republic of senegal: xfs.dll and dns.dll.

The xfs.dll file was compiled on October 
19, 2019. it is likely that the ATM attack 
was carried out on this day, and this 
is evidence of the last such successful 
attack conducted by silence. At the 
time, the main Trojan used by silence 
was XdA.RAT.

The XdA.RAT source code is based 
on an open-source project: https://
github.com/iagox86/dnscat2. The 
application supports the following 
commands:

 — 0: ping command

 — 1: create a cmd.exe process

 — 2: execute a shell command

 — 3: download a file

 — 4: upload a file from the infected 
device to the C&C server

 — 5: close all connections

 — 6: change the interval of making 
requests to the server

 — 7: save the %lOCAlAPPdATA%\
updatea.bin file

 — 8: overwrite the <%XdA_path%>\
updatea2.bin file

 — 9: get information about the con-
nected dispenser

 — 10: carry out an ATM jackpotting 
attack

state=%d, safedoor=%d, dispenser=%d, stacker=%d

pos=%d, OutputPosition=%d, shutter=%d, transport=%d

...

pos=%d, OutputPosition=%d, shutter=%d, transport=%d

...

id:%s(nr=%d)(l=%d,h=%d), %d|%d|%d of %d [%s][%d][%d],[%d][%d]

it is important to note that the functionality for working with ATMs has been bor-
rowed from xfs-disp.exe, which we described in our report on silence. The XdA.RAT 
source code is therefore based on two projects: dnscat2 and xfs-disp.exe.

When the Trojan receives the 9 command, it collects information in the same way 
as xfs-disp.exe:

1. it attempts to connect to the following dispenser service providers:

 — Cashdispenser (Nautilus)

 — NXCdm (Nautilus)

 — dBd_AdvFuncdisp (diabold)

 — Currencydispenser1 (NCR)

 — CdM30 (WiNCOR)

 — GEN (WiNCOR GEN)

 — ATM (GENERiC)

2. it logs the maximum number of banknotes that can be dispensed in a single 
operation (using WFs_iNF_CdM_CAPABiliTiEs).

3. it logs the current status of the dispenser (whether it is connected and busy), 
the state of the safe door, the state of the dispenser’s logical cash units, the state 
of the shutter, etc. The format is as follows:

4. it logs information about the status and contents of ATM cassettes. The output 
is displayed as a format string:

The application receives the following parameters with the 10 command:

 — Flag. 

 — if this value is 0, the application withdraws cash from a specific cash unit.

 — if this value is 1, the application withdraws cash from all cash units.

 — integer value: Cash unit index

 — integer value: Cash count

The application performs ATM jackpotting attacks in the same way as xfs-disp.exe. 
The only difference is that the application can extract a specific amount of money 
from a given cash unit.

THREATS TO THE 
RETAIL SECTOR 

There are four main threats that could 
critically damage retail businesses:

 — Js sniffers 

 — Attacks on POs terminals

 — Credential stuffing 

 — Ransomware 

Ransomware attacks are easy to under-
stand and, as a rule, companies are 
aware of them. As such, we will discuss 
only the first three threats underlying 
the carding and mass fraud market.

The carding market can be divided into 
two main segments: sale of textual 
card data (number, expiration date, 
holder's name, address, CVV) and sale 
of dumps (contents of magnetic stripe 
cards).

Textual data is collected using phishing 
websites, PC/Android banking Trojans, 
and ATMs. Threat actors intercept 

such data also by hacking e-commerce 
websites and using Js sniffers. The 
latter were this year’s main novelty and 
are becoming increasingly widespread 
among cybercriminals.

dumps are obtained using skimming 
devices and Trojans for computers with 
connected POs terminals.

The carding market has grown from 
$880 million last year to $1.9 billion. 
The doubling applies to both text data 
and dumps. The amount of text data 
offered for sale has increased from 
12.5 to 28.3 million cards, while dumps 
have surged from 41 to 63.7 million.

→ THREATs TO THE RETAil sECTOR 

Over the past year, the number 
of attacks on online stores has 
increased. This is because the use 
of Javascript sniffers to steal bank 
cards has become one of the main 
techniques of obtaining large volumes 
of payment information. The increase 
in attacks was also caused by the trend 
of reselling access to various websites 
and organizations on underground 
forums.

The most popular JS sniffer families

The number of known Js sniffer families 
has grown from 38 to 96 compared to the 
previous year. Each of the new families 
deserves to be analyzed separately.

According to Group-iB's findings, over 
the past year nearly 460,000 bank 
cards compromised using Js sniffers. 
Additionally, 645,000 bank cards were 
put up for sale at card shops for a total 
of $3.6 million.

The top nine banks that issued the 
stolen cards are located in the Us, with 
170,000 cards in total. Cybercriminals are 
also interested in cards issued in Brazil, 
Australia, Canada, spain, the United 
Kingdom, india, singapore, and France.

Lazarus, JS sniffers, and Bitcoin theft

in July 2020, security researchers 
reported that the state-sponsored APT 
group lazarus used Js sniffers to steal 
credit card data from 25 online stores 
worldwide.

Group-iB researchers identified two 
campaigns that involved infrastructure 
previously seen in attacks attributed 
to the North Korean group.

The first campaign began in May 2019. 
The attackers used the ClientToken 
sniffer family to infect 20 online stores. 

The second campaign began in February 
or March 2020 and targeted large online 
stores. in total, three websites were 
infected with the Preloader sniffer. 
Group-iB found two websites that the 
attackers used to collect cards stolen 
during the Preloader campaign, which 
may indicate a greater number of victims. 

Group-iB researchers also discovered 
the BTC Changer campaign, during which 
a modified version of ClientToken was 
used to spoof the address of a Bitcoin 
wallet at the time of payment on online 
stores that accept Bitcoin. specialists 
found two websites infected during this 
campaign, which brought the attackers 
0.66983720 BTC (approximately $7,800).

Sale of access to online stores

Access to hacked online stores — for 
the purpose of subsequently deploying 
a sniffer — can be purchased on under-
ground forums. The price heavily 
depends on the country in which the 
store operates, the number of buyers 
per day, and the type of payment system

in a separate window opened in an iframe 
or after being redirected to the payment 
system website, then it is more difficult 
to deploy a sniffer. such lots will there-
fore be cheaper than websites on which 
card data is entered on the website itself.

To gain access to a store or install 
a Js sniffer, cybercriminals continue 
to use known vulnerabilities in popular 
e-commerce CMs. They also employ 
malicious software to steal passwords 
and conduct brute-force attacks 
on administrative control panels of stores 
or dBMs. For example, threat actors 
continue to conduct attacks using the 
GoBrut malware written in Golang. The 
program is used to conduct distributed 
brute-force attacks on online stores and 
administrative panels of popular CMs 
such as Magento, OpenCart, phpMyAd-
min, and cPanel. subsequently, the threat 
actors leverage access to administrative 
panels and administration tools to install 
Js sniffers on the target websites.

Evasion techniques

To prevent malicious code from being 
detected and removed from the victim 
website, cybercriminals use several 
techniques.

 — Most techniques are based on using 
Javascript to load the main Js sniffer 
code when the user is on the check-
out page. in the past, Js sniffers were 
often loaded from a link using the 
script tag.      

 — Another increasingly popular tech-
nique involves concealing the 
Js sniffer code within an image. The 
injector code downloads the image 
from the attackers' server, extracts 
the Js sniffer code, and executes 
it on the online store page.      

 — Criminals still use the code for 
detecting whether a browser's con-
sole is open to avoid being detected 

by researchers and security tools. The 
malicious code will not be run and will 
not execute the main load if it detects 
that the browser's developer console 
is open on the visitor's website.      

 — To avoid detection, Js sniffer families 
also use several different checks 
under the responsibility of the serv-
er-side sniffer: the main Js sniffer 
code will be obtained only if (i) the 
user's iP address does not belong 
to the network of a large cloud pro-
vider, (ii) the user's country (deter-
mined by iP address) corresponds 
to the country of the store, and (iii) 
the Referer field contains the address 
of the infected store's payment 
page. if at least one of these checks 
fails, a benign Js script of a legiti-
mate library is returned in response 
to a sniffer code request.      

 — loading the main sniffer code using 
Javascript helps attackers conceal 
the address from which the code 
is loaded. The simplest code samples 
use Base64 to hide links to malicious 
Js files. However, we often find 
samples of malicious code in which 
the link to the Js sniffer is stored 
in encrypted form and as a concat-
enation of parts of a URl address 
or a string with a reverse character 
order.    

 — Group-iB Researchers also found 
samples of malicious code that used 
the domain Generation Algorithm 
(dGA) to obtain the website address 
from which the main sniffer code will 
be downloaded. The actual address 
depended on the exact date that the 
attackers created one domain for 
each month. if one of the domains 
was blocked, all they had to do was 
wait and the flow of bank card data 
from the infected store would resume.

The main product sold by carders is bank 
card dumps. in total, 63.7 million dumps 
were found for sale during the reporting 
period, which is 156% more than last 
year.

The main method of compromising 
magnetic stripe data is infecting com-
puters with connected POs terminals 
with special Trojans that collect data 
from RAM. in total, 14 Trojans were found 
to be active during the reporting period:

 — RtPOs

 — TinyPOs

 — UdPOs

 — FighterPOs

 — diamondFox

 — GratefulPOs

 — FrameworkPOs

 — MajikPOs

 — dMsniff

 — PinkKite

 — BAdHATCH

 — Pillowmint

 — GlitchPOs

 — Alina POs

during the reporting period, Group-iB researchers established that 19 retail chains 
were compromised, as a result of which millions of bank cards were put up for sale.

→ THREATs TO THE RETAil sECTOR 

One of the most common security 
issues is the credential stuffing tech-
nique, i.e. extracting login-password 
pairs from various leaks (email, phone 
number, and other identification data 
can be the login) for subsequent brute-
force attacks.

The problem is that many users choose 
the same passwords for different 
resources, and if one resource becomes 
compromised, the same login creden-
tials could be used on others. it is also 
worth noting that currently almost 
all major leaks are initially put up for 

sale, then become publicly available 
on underground forums, which makes 
it easy for attackers to collect data-
bases for credential stuffing attacks. 
This applies to all retailers with personal 
accounts on online resources, but also 
to some bank accounts and e-wallets.

Gaining access to bank accounts  
and e-wallets

Bank accounts and e-wallets are among 
the most obvious targets for cybercrim-
inals. Hackers prefer attacking online 
resources that give direct access to the 
victim's money. some banks provide 
access to online banking using the pair 
email:password or phone:password, 
which makes them attractive targets.

it is difficult for cybercriminals 
to directly withdraw funds from banks 
because such operations usually require 
confirmation (two-factor authentication) 
from the account holder. This explains 
why this monetization method is not the 
most popular one.

That being said, e-wallets do not usually 
involve such sophisticated security 
measures as those deployed to protect 
bank accounts. After gaining access 
to the electronic wallet, attackers 
attempt to either make purchases 
at the victim’s expense or transfer the 
funds to another wallet, registered 
to a money mule, through various 
exchange services.

Monetizing reward points

Online and offline retailers often offer 
members of their loyalty programs 
cashback for purchases in the form 
of reward points or money. Reward 

points can usually be used to pay for 
only a part of a purchase, but in some 
cases they can be used to pay for 
an entire order.

 — A common method of monetizing 
reward points is by purchasing goods 
that can later be resold. Criminals 
purchase gift cards for stores that 
sell digital content (e.g., Playstation 
store, Xbox store), then resell the 
cards or use them to pay in-store.

 — if attackers gain access to many user 
accounts, they can group reward 
points together and pay for a large 
number of purchases and/or buy 
more expensive goods.

 — in some retail chains, bonus points 
can be used to pay at checkout 
in-store. in such cases, cyber-
criminals use virtual loyalty cards, 
barcodes, and discount coupons 
from the user's personal account 
to cash in bonus points and pay for 
purchases.

Monetizing funds for paid services

some retailers offer services that can 
be paid for by topping up a personal 
account on the website.

if criminals gain access to a user 
account with a positive balance on their 
personal account, the threat actors can 
use these funds to obtain paid services 

from the retailer. in some cases, cyber-
criminals sell access to such accounts.

Receiving gift points or goods

Retailers offer users rewards and gifts 
for upgrading to a higher level of service 
or a more expensive tariff.

Attackers can take advantage of access 
to a user's account and independently 
transfer it to another level of service 
in order to receive a reward. The threat 
actor will then sell the reward.

Access to personal data

in the user's personal account on the 
retailer's website, attackers can gain 
access to the following personal data:

 — full name

 — contact information (phone number, 
email, delivery addresses)

 — data about payment methods (bank 
card and/or account numbers, 
accounts in payment systems)

if personal user data in the retail-
er's accounts is poorly protected, 
attackers can exfiltrate it for sub-
sequent social engineering attacks 
or to be sold to other interested parties.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

page 61 of 78

→ THREATs TO THE RETAil sECTOR 

To carry out such actions, threat actors 
need:

 — login-password lists from various 
leaks

 — lists of proxy servers to bypass 
blocking due to a limited num-
ber of requests allowed from one 
iP address

 — a program that will receive as input 
the lists of logins, proxies, and the 
address of the resource to check the 
existence of a user with such login 
and password details

Tools used to carry out the above 
attacks are of the greatest interest 
to threat hunters. They can be divided 
into three main categories:

 — bots without browsers 

 — browser bots   

 — hybrid solutions 

Bots without browsers

This is the most primitive way to imple-
ment such tools. Bots without browsers 
are extremely simple, they work reliably 
and quickly, but they cannot bypass 
anti-bot solutions.

There are many different offers 
of ready-made tools on the mar-
ket, but one of the most widespread 
is OpenBullet, an open source tool. its 
main advantage is extensibility. Threat 
actors must usually adapt the code 
for each online resource, which needs 

to be checked for certain user accounts. 
in OpenBullet, as in many other tools, 
the code is adapted in configuration 
files. This means that many users 
write configuration files for different 
resources, and the largest of them have 
long been on the list.

A distinctive feature of paid resources 
is a more comprehensive offer. 
developers of paid tools constantly 
update proxy lists and write log parsers 
to extract contact and payment infor-
mation from personal accounts.

since it is easy to conduct attacks using 
bots without browsers, some scammers 
prefer to write their own scripts to per-
form attacks against specific resources.

Hybrid solutions

since bots without browsers cannot 
pass CAPTCHAs and receive cookies, 
scammers have developed a hybrid 
solution.

Criminals launch the browser either 
automatically or manually and receive 
cookies. The cookies are then added 
to the bot configuration file, after which 
the bots check login and password 
details (without the need to launch 
a browser). This scheme is easy 
to implement and, most importantly, 
it works quickly and does not require 
many computing resources.

To bypass various types of CAPTCHAs, 
hackers can use either separate tools 

that solve the simple types or saas 
services for their solution. in the 
latter case, scammers automatically 
send the link to the service via the 
APi and receive a cookie or a solution 
in response.

Hybrid methods can bypass almost all 
anti-bot solutions.

Browser bots

it is rare to find resources with reliable 
protection. More often than not, these 
are large social media or iT giants that 
use their own solutions to protect 
against bots. in such cases, scammers 
write unique browser bots for each 
resource.

Browser bots are full-fledged browsers 
that automatically start, open pages, 
run scripts, and emulate user behavior 
on a website.

This variant is much more expensive 
than the previous ones. it requires 
a great deal of customization, while 
running many browsers requires more 
server power and, most importantly, 
is much slower.

BANKING 
TROJANS

Every year, several banking botnets dis-
appear from the market and new ones 
rarely take their place. This year was 
no exception. At this rate, the market for 
PC banking Trojans may become nonex-
istent in three to five years. 

Latin America
remains the main source of this type of threat

→ BANKiNG TROJANs

A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were 
active this year, 12 of which were writ-
ten by Russian-speaking developers. 
six Trojans were developed by latin 
American authors. 

Russian-speaking owners of the largest 
banking botnets have also followed the 
main trend of switching to using ran-
somware. For example:

 — Trickbot uses the following ransom-
ware: Ryuk  (later Conti), Kraken, 
Thanos  

 — dridex uses Wastedlocker, 
doppelPaymer; it previously used 
BitPaymer, locky, Bart, and Jaff

 — Qbot (Quakbot) started using 
Prolock

 — zloader/silent Night also switched 
to using an unidentified ransomware

 — RTM, which is the only banking bot-
net active in Russia, uses Cerber

A shift in focus does not mean that 
threat actors stop committing thefts. 
if they see an opportunity to transfer 
a large amount of money, they will 
take it. But as a general rule, their main 
income now comes from ransomware.

This change in behavior has led to less 
damage from theft and changed the 
money laundering market.

Given that the most widespread 
banking Trojans used to be developed 
by Russian-speaking cybercriminals, 
the decrease in thefts has led to this 
segment degrading more significantly. 

during the analyzed period, only 
one new banking Trojan developed 
by Russian-speaking authors appeared: 
silent Night. it is an improved version 
of the old Axebot Trojan and was used 
in attacks on German internet users. 
during the same period, another three 
Trojans created earlier by Russian-
speaking authors stopped being used 
completely: TinyNuke, Panda Banker, 
and Osiris.

Russia

The only banking Trojan for PCs 
in Russia is RTM, which does not seem 
to be used much and will likely soon 
cease to exist. This banking botnet uses 
Cerber ransomware.

Latin America

latin America has become the main 
source of banking Trojans. in 2020, 
five new Trojans emerged: Guildma 
(Astaroth), Grandoreiro, Javali, Melcoz, 
and Metamorfo. All have been active for 
several years, but attracted the atten-
tion of researchers only recently.

The developers of these Trojans live 
in latin America and their Trojans are 
used locally, although some of them are 
starting to attack Europe and the United 
states.

USA and Canada

Traditionally, the Us and Canada have 
been the primary targets for banking 
Trojans. Even latin American developers 
have added American banks to their 
config files.

Currently, eleven Trojans for PCs pose 
a threat to clients of Us and Canadian 
banks, ten of which were devel-
oped by Russian-speaking hackers: 
Metamorfo, zloader/silent Night, 
Gootkit, Trickbot, Gozi, icedid, danabot, 
Ramnit, dridex, lokiPWs, and Qbot.

APAC

in the APAC region, banking Trojans 
have barely undergone any significant 
changes. The key targets are Japan and 
Australia, which are attacked using well-
known Trojans: Trickbot, Gozi, danabot, 
Ramnit.

Trojans for PC

Old and active Guildma (Astaroth), Grandoreiro, Javali, Melcoz, CamuBot, 
Metamorfo, Qbot, Gootkit, Trickbot, Gozi (isFB, Ursnif, 
dreambot), icedid (Bokbot), Ramnit. Backswap, dridex, 
lokiPWs, Retefe, RTM, danabot

Old and active Anubis, Flexnet, Gustuff, BasBanke (Coybot), Cerberus

New Ginp, Alien Bot, BlackRock, Hydra, EventBot

Disappeared Red Alert, Asacub

The Android Trojan market is similar 
to the PC Trojan market. The main devel-
opers are Russian-speaking hackers. 
However, developers from latin America 
are actively expanding to the market 
and use their tools to attack bank cus-
tomers locally.

in total, ten Android banking Trojans 
were active this year, five of which are 
brand new. 

An author of the Red Alert banking 
Trojan with the nickname sochi stopped 
developing Trojans and switched 
to working with Js sniffers.

Authors of Android Trojans are not picky 
about names. For instance, Alien Bot 
appeared in 2020, but Trojans with the 
same name but from other developers 
had existed before.

Android Trojans mainly use web fakes, 
i.e. dialog boxes that request the 
information required (passwords, bank 
card numbers, etc.) from the victim. 
services offering to develop such web 
fakes appeared in the Russian-speaking 
underground segment. As a result, 
banking Trojan authors no longer need 

Trojans for Android

to spend time supporting certain 
applications for collecting financial data. 
it is enough to buy a set of web fakes 
and the Trojan can be used in almost 
any region, which is what usually hap-
pens with Trojans created by Russian-
speaking cybercriminals.

Russia

Only two Android Trojans were active 
in Russia: Flexnet and Anubis. They 
did not cause significant damage. For 
example, Flexnet spread more mas-
sively and was able to infect 50,000 
devices and intercept data from just 
over 5,000 bank cards.

Anubis spread more selectively, using 
landing pages disguised a Russian bank 
brand, and infected about 400 clients 
in a targeted way.

Latin America

The locally developed BasBanke Trojan 
was most active in latin America. 
BasBanke works as part of an affiliate 
scheme, i.e. several people can distrib-
ute it at once.

USA and Canada

Russian-speaking authors adhere to the 
unspoken rule that Android Trojans 
should not be used to attack Us clients, 
although the authors of web fakes are 
actively creating windows to collect 
data from Us financial institutions.

Only two Trojans pose a threat: the new 
Alien Bot and BlackRock.

APAC

Threats for the APAC region are posed 
by all Trojans developed by Russian-
speaking hackers: Anubis, Gustuff, 
Cerberus, and the new Alien Bot.

Between H2 2019 and H2 2020, 118% 
more phishing resources were identified 
and taken down compared to the previ-
ous reporting period.

This significant growth can be explained 
by two main factors:

 — The pandemic. during lockdowns, 
many attackers had more time 
to devote to malicious activity. 
in addition, phishing, as one of the 
simplest earning schemes, attracted 
the attention of a larger audience 
as many people lost their income 
due to the pandemic.      

 — On the other hand, lockdowns 
increased the demand for online 
shopping. More and more people 
began to order goods and services 

from home. scammers quickly 
adapted to this trend and began 
carrying out phishing attacks on ser-
vices and individual brands, which 
previously did not have much finan-
cial appeal to them. 

 — Change of tactics. in previous years, 
attackers ended their campaigns 
after fraudulent websites were taken 
down and quickly switched to other 
brands. Today, they are automating 
their attacks instead and replacing 
the blocked pages with new ones. 

Phishing attacks targeting bookmak-
ers increased in Q2 2020, amounting 
to 6% versus 2% in the previous quarter. 
Compared to H2 2018-H1 2019, phishing 
targeting bookmakers grew by more 

than 20% during the reporting period.

Postal services and financial institutions 
also remained a key target for attackers.

Another attack type that increased sig-
nificantly was phishing used to collect 
accounts for various online services 
such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, 
eBay, and Valve steam.

Phishing resources targeting cryptocur-
rency projects have disappeared almost 
completely. The main reason lies in the 
waning interest in iCO projects, which 
were a key target for phishers in 2017 
and 2018.

H2 2018 — H1 2019 H2 2019 — H1 2020

Government resources 0.3% 0.1%

Financial institutions 18.3% 15.0%

Phishing evasion techniques

so far, the main 2020 trend is the use 
of one-time unique links that become 
inactive after the user opens them. 
This means that if someone clicks 
on the link at least once, it will not 
be possible to obtain the same content 
again in order to collect evidence. This 
significantly complicates the process 
of taking down phishing resources.

Common evasion techniques used 
by phishers are listed below:

 — One-time links. A unique one-time 
link is generated for each user.

 — Blocking by subnets. The subnets 
of many companies that provide 
phishing page detection services 
are blacklisted, and if a request for 
a page comes from their subnets, 
phishing content will not be shown.

 — Blocking by user agent. Attackers 
understand who their target audi-
ence is, and if it is clear from the 
user agent that this is not a real user, 
phishing content will not be shown. 
For example, if a criminal carries out 
an attack on mobile device users, all 
visitors with a PC browser will not 
receive the phishing page. Phishing 
kit scripts usually contain a list 
of keywords that are checked in the 
user agent field.      

 — Blocking by region. GeoiP data-
bases are actively used by various 
criminals and phishing is no excep-
tion. if the target audience is located 
in singapore, there is no point 
in showing the phishing page 
to users in the United states.

 — Redirects to official  
websites. if some checks are 
failed, instead of phishing content 
visitors will be redirected to the 
attacked brand’s official website 
or to websites belonging to other 
legal services.

Affiliate programs

Phishing scammers cannot do much 
damage on their own. As such, there are 
affiliate programs that bring together 
people who want to make money 
by phishing.

in Russia, the main reason for the sig-
nificantly higher numbers of phishing 
attacks is the emergence of various 
affiliate programs for hackers wanting 
to make money off phishing involving 
fake bank rewards programs, lottery 
draws, paid surveys, and more. At the 
final stage of the scam, the victim 
is prompted to enter their payment 
details or make a transfer.

The affiliates distribute links to as many 
people as possible. Affiliate program 
organizers create landing pages, accept 
payments, and help launder money. For 
example, in a short period of time, one 
of the affiliate programs created more 
than 12,000 accounts of money mules 
to transfer stolen money.

so far, this trend has been observed 
only in Russia. Russia is often used 
as a testing ground, so similar schemes 
are likely to appear in other countries.

Automated management  
of phishing projects

since the start of the year, there has 
been a rise in advanced social engineer-
ing, namely when multi-stage scenarios 
are used in a phishing attack. As part 
of such increasingly popular phish-
ing schemes, threat actors first stake 
out the victim: they establish contact 
with the target individual (e.g., through 
a messenger), create an atmosphere 
of trust, and only then do they direct 
the victim to a phishing page.

Communications between members 
of such new criminal gangs are espe-
cially interesting. Hackers coordinate 
attacks, communicate, and distribute 

stolen funds through dedicated 
Telegram channels and bots. A typical 
infrastructure for such a project built 
around Telegram might include the 
following features:

 — a bot for recruiting, where informa-
tion about a new potential cyber-
group member is entered  (scam-
ming experience, age, link to a profile 
on the forum, etc.)

 — a bot for displaying information 
about successful thefts (nickname 
in Telegram, how much money was 
made and how)

 — private channels for interaction/com-
munication/support for members 
of the scam group

 — bots for generating phishing links 
based on certain settings, which 
are introduced by group members 
during attacks

in addition to the traditional phish-
ing kits, underground hacker forums 
nowadays offer ready-made manage-
ment platforms designed to automate 
phishing projects. Thanks to such plat-
forms distributed as saas, the number 
of groups that can be easily scaled 
is growing. The number of members 
in a group built around such plat-
forms can reach several dozen people. 
Automating management of a criminal 
group in turn leads to the emergence 
and spread of more complex social 
engineering. The latter is slowly starting 
to be used in large-scale attacks and 
not only in targeted attacks as before.

Nowadays, threat actors are continuously innovating. 
Criminals implement new tools with more enthusiasm and 
much faster than many companies. This is what affects the 
balance of power on the information security battlefield. Take 
advantage of the latest developments and solution classes 
available on the market to prevent your opponent from gain-
ing the upper hand.

Even the latest generation of automated security systems 
are managed by a team. it is this team of specialists that 
determines how much of the product's capabilities you use 
and therefore the effectiveness of the solution. learning and 
innovation must become a continuous process.

The number of people in your response team and existence 
of playbooks is just as important as the coherence and 
interchangeability of each unit within that team. Consultants 
always advise you to assign roles in the team, but do you 
conduct "rehearsals" on a regular basis? do all team members 
know how they should act in any given situation? involve your 
team in creating a playbook and establish effective interac-
tion between teams and employees.

Team

Technologies

Three pillars of information security

General recommendations

Processes

IS*

*information security

Threat hunting  
and proactive defense

Monitoring and proactive threat detection are not new for the cyber industry, but not everyone 
is managing to implement these processes. you need to constantly collect and match indicators 
of compromise and TTPs of attackers. Train your team in new techniques, improve their skills, 
and provide them with the latest tools.

Hygiene  
and hygiene

Phishing and social engineering have remained the most popular vectors of initial compro-
mise. Ordinary employees hold their defenses behind their monitors and inboxes every day. 
Establishing a password policy and conducting training and social engineering testing will help 
protect against phishing and prevent corporate data leaks.

Trust MSS providers  
and partners

Product innovations aren’t slowing down their momentum, and technical skills are always 
needed to ensure information security. Therefore, more companies are delegating part or most 
of their information security tasks to Mss providers. doing so not gets best-in-class technical 
specialists at your side without hiring but also is beneficial for budget allocation.

Keep in touch with  
your competitors

To raise awareness of new threats, you need to go beyond professional trainings and start a dia-
logue with colleagues from your industry. Competitors could become your partners in the fight 
against common enemies: APTs, pro-state groups, ransomware attacks, and others.

Checkups and cyber  
risk insurance

Just as people need regular checkups, so do companies need to regularly assess their security 
infrastructures. Nowadays, this applies not only to infrastructure but also to teams and pro-
cesses. The standard set of checkups should be supplemented with a third-party audit as well 
as an assessment of potential retrospective compromise. it is important to note that the above 
does not negate the importance of cyber risk insurance, especially when you are responsible for 
the information of your customers and employees.

Measuring  
performance

information security is becoming more expensive for companies, which is why many are 
requesting that the effectiveness of solutions be measured and compared. The saturated 
market dictates the new rules: solutions should not just be modern and efficient but also 
advantageous for businesses. Comparing costs to the effectiveness of a tool in its pilot stage 
also requires defining business metrics that differ in one way or another from the size of the 
company and its infrastructure. Analysts from Gartner, Forrester, and other analytical agencies 
handle the market's requests to collect performance measurements and their metrics.

 — Hunt for traces of covert activity 
by threat actors in the company 
network. This helps stop an ongoing 
attack for which the initial stages were 
overlooked by the organization's secu-
rity controls.

 — implement a Malware detonation 
Platform that allows for suspicious 
files and links to be run in an isolated 
environment, be analyzed in detail, 
and subsequently blocked if found 
to be malicious. 

 — Use a Threat intelligence solution 
to identify threats, leaks, breaches, 
and other hacker activity before they 
can harm you.

 — Back up regularly. Any backups must 
be separated from the main network 
so that they cannot be accessed 
by threat actors if administrator 
accounts become compromised.

 — Conduct round-the-clock monitoring 
of information security events and 
be prepared to promptly respond.

 — Each incident should be matched with 
its level of complexity. incidents that 
require analysis should be inves-
tigated, the causes and conse-
quences should be identified, and the 
problems that caused the incident 
should be fixed. For the second level 
of response, it is important to have 
a third-party incident response team 
with pre-negotiated agreement that 
can assist in stopping a complex 
targeted attack.

 — Make sure that your team has the 
necessary skills to perform threat 
hunting and collect threat intelligence.

 — Conduct regular digital hygiene train-
ing for employees. 

 — Perform security assessments 
in a format that simulates real-life 
actions taken by cybercriminals. This 
approach will help identify weak-
nesses in the company's iT infra-
structure and determine whether 
the company is ready to combat real 
cyberattacks. 

 — Conduct periodic fraud risk assess-
ments to see if your solutions and pro-
cedures can defend against existing 
attacks and fraudulent schemes that 
use different attack channels. identify 
the main risk factors, and start from 
existing and possible problems when 
choosing a fraud protection solution.

 — Create a layered protection for your 
web portal using not only transaction 
analysis, but also solutions for session 
analysis of behavior and devices, 
and unveil fraudulent operations that 
occur on your web channel. leave 
only legitimate users on your portal 
and take actions regarding blocking 
suspicious users or bots.

Unfortunately, it is not always possi-
ble to detect attacks at early stages: 
threat actors continuously improve their 
skills and implement new techniques 
to gain access to networks of various 
size. detecting traces of compromise 
at different stages of the cyber kill chain 
requires an ia ntegrated approach. This 
approach involves creating a centralized 
data source about what is happening 
in the network infrastructure and isolat-
ing compromised hosts. XdR solutions 
can be used for these purposes, as they 
are able to detect malicious activity 

at various layers, regardless of the tac-
tics, techniques, and procedures used 
by threat actors.

Reducing cyber attacker dwell time also 
requires not only high-quality response 
but also proactive analysis, which can 
be carried out both by the organiza-
tion's employees with relevant com-
petencies and by outsourced experts. 
The latter speeds up the investigation 
and improves the quality of analysis 
significantly.

Both reactive and proactive approaches 
require not only relevant competencies 
but also a significant amount of cyber 
threat intelligence data. strategic, 
operational and tactical threat data help 
organizations identify attackers during 
the ongoing analysis and detect signs 
of compromise at the earliest stages.

Primitive errors: vulnerable 
software versions in publicly 
accessible services or weak 
passwords; vulnerabilities 
with public exploits

 — Update software regularly.

 — Automatically inventory software to identify outdated 
programs.

 — Regularly conduct security assessments and penetration 
testing to identify weaknesses in the network and establish 
possible attack vectors.

 — Enhance your password policy.

 — implement multi-factor authentication.

 — implement VPNs to protect services on the external network 
perimeter. if this is not an option, set up an ssO.

Distributed brute-force 
attacks on remote access 
interfaces (RDP, SSH, VPN) 
and other services (using  
new botnets)

 — Make an inventory of the external network perimeter, firewall 
rules, and network address translation (NAT) rules to prevent 
services from being externally accessible by mistake.

 — do not, under any circumstances or even temporarily, make 
devices that can easily be compromised accessible from the 
internet. These include devices used for video surveillance, 
smart homes, office equipment (printers, scanners, and mul-
tifunctional devices), and storage such as NAs servers in the 
sOHO segment.

 — Ensure that remote access services for operating systems 
are not accessible externally (e.g., RdP, ssH, VNC, sMB/RPC). 

 — if this cannot be avoided, change the ssH/RdP port 
to a non-default one and implement a white list 
of iP addresses that can access these services.

 — Ensure that remote access meets the following 
requirements:

 — Multi-factor authentication.

 — Enhanced password policy.

 — The ability to restrict network access for the tasks 
of a specific account (e.g., contractors are granted 
access only to servers they need, not the entire segment 
or network).

 — set fields such as "expires at" for accounts and access rules 
in case manual revocation of remote access fails.

 — Make an inventory of the external network perimeter,

Ransomware  — Be prepared to identify signs of initial compromise, 
methods used to achieve persistence in the system, and 
lateral movement. Although attack techniques are usually 
primitive and can be detected with the naked eye, more 
advanced attacks can be identified only by hunting for 
threats. 

 — Regularly check your infrastructure for known bad indicators 
of compromise.

 — The success of ransomware affiliate programs depends 
on an organization's overall level of security. We recommend 
using security systems such as Group-iB Threat Hunting 
Framework and Group-iB Threat intelligence 
& Attribution.

Post-exploitation frame-
works: a free tool called 
Metasploit and a cracked 
version of Cobalt Strike. 
Less often, the frameworks 
PoshC2 and Koadic.

 — Ensure that your security tools are able to detect tracks 
of popular post-exploitation frameworks.

 — Ensure that a sufficient number of different and unique 
data sources are used when assessing the security level 
of your infrastructure and preparing for attacks.

Supply-chain attacks  — Ensure that your current security tools are able to detect anomalous activity when legitimate software is being used. 
such activity may include launches of atypical processes, 
creation of files, and file system or registry modifications 
that are usually used to achieve persistence in the system. 

 — Common security tools are usually unable to han-
dle such tasks, therefore we recommend considering 
Group-iB Threat Hunting Framework.

Privilege escalation using 
various software (e.g., 
Mimikatz, LaZagne) or  
brute-force attacks

To counteract Mimikatz, we recommend:

 — Update your systems to Windows 10/2016 with the 
Credentials Guard feature.

 — Use the Protected Users group for administrator accounts.

 — Build a privileged access management system in accord-
ance with Microsoft recommendations.

 — if you believe that attackers may bypass the methods listed 
above, or if it is impossible to implement the above recom-
mendations, ensure that the existing security controls are 
able to detect the use of Mimikatz (most often launched 
using post-exploitation frameworks).

 — log access to lsass.exe process memory and identify suspi-
cious processes that may perform such activity.

Tools for attacks on physi-
cally isolated networks  
that use USB devices  
for jumping the air gap

do not use untrusted UsB devices or UsB devices of unknown/
questionable origin.

 — implement Group-iB Threat Hunting Framework and 
Group-iB Threat intelligence & Attribution to check your 
organization for compromise.

Credential stuffing  — Prevent users from registering on any third-party ser-vices using corporate emails. Users tend to use the same 
password on multiple services or modify their passwords. 
if passwords are leaked from one service, a hacker can 
attack a given company directly.

 — A threat actor can use a breached password to conduct 
a social engineering attack against a specific user.

 — Check databases of leaked credentials for your accounts 
(e.g., using Group-iB Threat intelligence & Attribution).

New records in DDoS attack 
volume: 2.3 Tb per second

 — increase bandwidth.

 — Purchase filtering hardware.

 — switch to operators with relevant anti-ddos capacities.

Banking botnets, Trojans 
(TrickBot, Qbot, Silent Night 
and others)

1. Attack on vulnerable software: browsers, operating systems

 — Perform timely software updates

 — do not click on suspicious links

 — do not install software from untrusted sources

2. Phishing campaigns:

 — do not open suspicious emails and attachments.

 — Use Group-iB Threat Hunting Framework and similar solutions.

such Trojans are well known and leave specific traces in the

Web phishing and  
social engineering

Recommendations for marketplace customers:

 — Pay attention to domain names, especially those shown 
in search engine ads and conversations with sellers.

 — do not switch to communicating outside market-
places, since chat histories will not be saved, and the 
resource's anti-fraud rules will not work.

 — Pay attention to the seller rating.

Recommendations for marketplaces:

 — Create a fraud prevention system.

 — Use Group-iB Fraud Hunting Platform.

Recommendations for other websites,  
online stores, and their visitors:

 — Check the date when the domain name was registered and 
whether the domain is spelled correctly.

 — Check the website content, including product descriptions 
and user reviews.

 — Be attentive to websites that appear on the top of adver-
tising in search engines. Cybercriminals often buy such ads 
to promote their websites. 

 — Be attentive to websites where the price of products  
is set too low.

 — implement Group-iB Fraud Hunting Platform  
and Group-iB digital Risk Protection.

and escalate privileges

 — install packages only using official repositories

 — Carefully check information about developers of packages 
that are not available in official repositories.

 — Follow general cybersecurity recommendations of the 
linux communities (e.g., remove sUid bits off unnecessary 
binaries).

 — Use minimum privileges when using untrusted software.

Mobile RATs  — do not install untrusted software 
 — do not listen to intruders trying to persuade you to install 

TeamViewer and any other software to connect a tech 
support employee. 

 — Update software and operating systems in a timely manner. 

For our clients: use Group-iB Fraud Hunting Platform, which 
is able to detect active RATs on mobile devices.

→ TECHNiCAl RECOMMENdATiONs FOR COUNTERACTiNG CyBERATTACKs

Gaining access to SCADA 
systems at industrial enter-
prises to manipulate produc-
tion processes

 — The success of such attacks is highly dependent on your 
organization's level of security.

 — implement Group-iB's Threat Hunting Framework and 
Group-iB Threat intelligence & Attribution systems to check 
whether your organization has been compromised

Exploits and spyware suits 
for Android and iOS

 — do not visit untrusted/suspicious websites.

 — do not install software from unverified sources.

 — Perform timely updates of operating systems and software 

 — separate personal and work devices.

 — Use one device for work, the other for personal life, do not 
mix them.

 — Use Group-iB Fraud Hunting Platform and Group-iB Threat 
intelligence & Attribution (with notifications on new attacks, 
new software, and exploits).

Initial compromise  
through VPN servers

 — Ensure that remote access meets the following 
requirements: 

 — Multi-factor authentication 

 — Enhanced password policy 

 — The ability to restrict network access for the tasks 
of a specific account (e.g., contractors are granted 
access only to servers they need, not the entire seg-
ment or network) 

 — set fields such as "expires at" for accounts and access 
rules in case manual revocation of remote access fails.
