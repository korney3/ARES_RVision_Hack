Executive summary 

Highlights of Q2 2020 include:

 � The number of cyberincidents is continuing to grow. In Q2 2020, we detected 

9 percent more attacks than in Q1 2020. Most attacks in the first two quarters 

of the year happened in April and May, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 � The percentage of attacks targeting industrial companies has increased signif-

icantly. In attacks on organizations, industrial companies were attacked in 15 

percent of cases, compared to 10 percent in Q1. Ransomware operators and 

cyberespionage APT groups are among those who seem to be the most inter-

ested in industrial companies.

 � Among social engineering attacks, 16 percent capitalized on the COVID-19 pan-

demic. More than a third (36%) of such attacks were not related to any specific 

industry, 32 percent targeted individuals, and 13 percent were aimed at govern-

ment institutions.

 � In the cybercriminal world, the demand for credentials is growing. Of the total 

amount of data stolen in attacks against organizations, the share of creden-

tials has doubled in comparison with Q1. The most common credential theft 

scenarios include exploitation of web vulnerabilities, phishing emails, malware 

infection, and bruteforcing of credentials for services on the network perimeter 

of companies.

 � In attacks on organizations, exploitation of software vulnerabilities and config-

uration flaws accounted for 18 percent, compared to 9 percent in Q1. Internet-

accessible corporate network resources are especially attractive to attackers. 

Criminals have been actively exploiting vulnerabilities in remote access systems 

from Palo Alto, Pulse Secure, and Citrix.

 � Ransomware trojans were present in 39 percent of malware attacks on organ-

izations. A quarter of ransomware attacks on organizations targeted industrial 

companies. Attackers continue to threaten disclosure of stolen data if victims 

refuse to pay. LockBit, Ragnar Locker, and Maze operators have joined forces 

in a so-called Maze cartel to sell stolen data.

 � Besides ransomware operators, other threat actors now blackmail victims with 

disclosure of  stolen data and  the prospect of fines  for  violating  the General 

Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR).

To protect from cyberattacks, we recommend following our guidelines for ensuring 

personal and corporate cybersecurity. Whether you continue to work remotely or 

go back to your usual routine, remember that criminals are always on the look-

out for easy prey. They regularly update malicious tactics and techniques so that 

their actions remain unnoticed in infrastructure for a long time. A web application 

firewall (WAF), proper incident management, deep analysis of network traffic, as 

well as use of sandbox and SIEM solutions can help to detect attacks in time. SIEM 

capabilities provide constant monitoring of infrastructure security incidents, de-

tection of sophisticated attacks on domains, and support for secure remote work.

Statistics

In Q2, the number of attacks increased by 9 percent compared to Q1—and by 59 percent com-

pared to Q2 2019. Significant world events consistently lead to increases in cybercrime, as they 

provide fertile ground for social engineering attacks. April and May 2020 were record-break-

ing in terms of successful cyberattacks. This sharp increase was spurred by epidemiological 

and economic crisis.

Malware attacks

Attackers tend to infect victims with a whole array of trojans, not just a single piece of malware. 

In one mass malware campaign, criminals delivered LokiBot spyware to victims' computers to 

steal saved user credentials from various applications. In addition, LokiBot downloaded Jigsaw 

ransomware to compromised devices. Ransomware and spyware are the most common trojans 

used in malware attacks. In Q2, they accounted for 39 percent and 34 percent of all malware 

attacks on organizations, respectively.

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-phishing-campaign-packs-an-info-stealer-ransomware-punch/


Hackers constantly refine their malware by adding new functionality. For example, Valak mal-

ware previously was a mere trojan loader. Now it can also be used independently as an infor-

mation stealer hunting for credentials and domain certificates. Another example is Sarwent. 

Its developers have added a module that provides remote access to compromised hosts 

via the RDP protocol. Sarwent enables RDP on compromised hosts and changes Windows 

Firewall settings to allow connections. It cannot be ruled out that the attackers will sell or rent 

out such access to other cybercriminals. In May we published an article in which we discussed 

the illegal sale of access to corporate networks in more detail.

Malware is refined not only to add new functionality, but to incorporate more sophisticated 

techniques  for bypassing protection. For example, specialists  from the PT Expert Security 

Center (PT ESC) detected an updated version of Calypso APT malware. The attackers 

changed the name of export functions in the main library and set an implausible compilation 

time (supposedly in 2021). By doing so, they probably were trying to reduce the odds of be-

ing spotted by antivirus software.

Figure 9. Implausible compilation time of Calypso malware

Figure 10. Message from the Gamaredon APT group to a Ukrainian government agency

In Q2 2020, PT ESC detected  13 attacks by  the Gamaredon APT group. The group keeps 

attacking Ukrainian government institutions. They have taken to the technique of  remote 

VBS script loading with mshta.exe. This  technique uses built-in Windows  tools and allows 

bypassing AppLocker restrictions on program launch. The script runs after opening of an 

LNK file  from a phishing message.

Industrial companies  
in the crosshairs
In attacks on organizations, industrial companies were targeted in 15 per-

cent of cases (compared to 10% in Q1). In nine out of ten cases, attackers 

used malware. About half of malware attacks (46%) involved ransomware, 

and 41 percent of attacks used spyware trojans. 

In our cybersecurity threatscape report for Q1 2020, we talked about new 

ransomware called Snake that is capable of halting ICS processes. In Q2, 

we learned about the first victims—Japanese automaker Honda and ener-

gy giant Enel Group. Industrial companies were also struck by other ran-

somware operators,  including Maze, Sodinokibi, NetWalker, Nefilim,  and 

DoppelPaymer.

Phishing emails and exploitation of network perimeter vulnerabilities were 

the initial vectors of attacks on industrial companies. According to Bad 

Packets, the Sodinokibi operators penetrated the corporate network of 

Elexon by exploiting vulnerability CVE-2019-11510 in the Pulse Secure VPN.

Cisco Talos discovered attacks on the Azerbaijani energy sector, in which criminals 

demonstrated interest in SCADA systems related to wind turbines. The attacks started with 

phishing messages that contained malicious attachments. Among other subject lines, the 

messages used lures related to COVID-19. The RTM APT group also uses phishing against 

industrial companies in Russia and the CIS. PT ESC detected 44 malicious mailings by the 

group  during  the  second  quarter  of  the  year.

COVID-19 as a social engineering ruse
In Q2, attackers have been actively exploiting COVID-19 concerns. COVID-19 was leveraged 

in 16 percent of social engineering attacks. More than a third (36%) of such attacks were not 

related to any specific industry, while 32 percent of attacks targeted individuals. Government 

institutions were targeted in 13 percent of COVID-19 social engineering attacks. PT ESC 

detected attacks involving Chinoxy malware against companies in Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam.

https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/poetrat-covid-19-lures.html


The attackers used the Royal Road exploit builder to create a document exploiting vulnerability 

CVE-2018-0798  in Equation Editor. The document claimed to contain  information about aid 

from the United Nations to these countries in the fight against COVID-19. 

Figure 17. Document containing Chinoxy malware

Figure 18. Document containing KONNI malware

In  Q2,  PT  ESC  discovered  five  phishing  campaigns  in  which  KONNI  malware  was  deliv-

ered. The criminals lured the victims with information on personal protective equipment for 

COVID-19.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0798


Malicious emails were not the only technique attackers used to capitalize on the crisis. They 

also created fake pandemic-related websites hosting malware disguised as useful information, 

performed business email compromise attacks to steal money, and distributed malicious ap-

plications. For example, attackers distributed the SLocker Android trojan disguised as an app 

called Koronavirus haqida, which means "About Coronavirus" in Uzbek. The trojan locked the 

screen of the victim's phone, prompting to pay to regain control of the device. Another exam-

ple is CryCryptor Android ransomware, which masqueraded as Covid-19 Tracer App to attack 

users in Canada. In most cases, such mobile trojans are distributed via websites, which is why 

we do not recommend installing applications from unofficial sources.

On the hunt for credentials
Thirty percent of all data stolen in attacks on organizations were credentials, an increase from 

15 percent in Q1. Corporate credentials are the most valuable kind of information for attack-

ers. Criminals sell them on the darkweb or use them for further attacks, such as imitating the 

hacked company to send emails with malicious attachments. Databases with credentials of 

hacked companies' clients are also in high demand.

Here we will review the most common scenarios of credential compromise attacks performed 

in Q2 2020.

1. Hacking of web resources and theft of credential databases. In Q2, attackers primarily 

targeted online services, e-shops, and service sector companies. In most cases, they ex-

ploited web vulnerabilities or bruteforced passwords to access websites. For example, the 

Shiny Hunters group posted an advertisement on the darkweb offering the databases of 

dozens of companies. Among the victims were e-learning platform Unacademy, The Daily 

Chronicle news website, the Knock CRM platform, and many others. A single database gen-

erally costs between $1,000 and $2,000. However, the database of online store Tokopedia, 

containing information for 91 million accounts, was offered on a darkweb market for $5,000.

2. Phishing emails with links to fake authentication forms. Most often, attackers forge the 

authentication forms of Microsoft products, such as Office 365, Outlook, and SharePoint. 

However, at the peak of the pandemic in Q2, they also tried to steal credentials for audio and 

videoconferencing platforms. In one such case, attackers deployed a phishing campaign 

against remote employees using Skype, sending them emails with fake Skype notifications. 

By clicking a link in a phishing email, the victims landed on a fraudulent login page and were 

asked to provide their credentials. Similar attacks hit users of Webex and Zoom.

3. Infection with credential-stealing malware.  In most  cases,  it  suffices  for  employees  to 

merely open a malicious phishing attachment to get their company infected with malware. 

Lately, in the footsteps of cybergroups, ransomware operators have also started hunting for 

credentials. In Q2, Zaha Hadid Architects became a victim of Light ransomware. The crimi-

nals stole a large number of internal files and compromised employees' accounts.

4. Bruteforcing of credentials to services on the network perimeter. In the first two quarters 

of 2020, such attacks have become especially relevant due to the global workforce’s shift 

to remote work, which made some services accessible from the Internet for the first time. In 

April, cybersecurity specialists observed an increasing number of attacks across the globe 

aimed at bruteforcing RDP credentials. In order not to fall victim to such attacks, it is vital 

to use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, as well as enable RDP connec-

tions only over corporate VPNs. If you do not use RDP, we recommend closing port 3389. 

Specially configured SIEM correlation rules help to detect bruteforce attacks on corporate 

remote access systems in time.

Figure 23. Credential compromise incident (MaxPatrol SIEM interface)

Network perimeter resources  
under attack
In Q2 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote work have led to an increase in 

attacks on vulnerabilities in web-accessible corporate services. As a result, the share of 

attacks  exploiting  software  vulnerabilities  and  configuration  flaws  has  increased  to  18 

percent in Q2 (compared to 9% in Q1). Criminals pursued various goals, from installation of 

miners to cyberespionage on large companies' networks.

 � CVE-2020-0688 (Microsoft Exchange)

In Q2 2020, hackers targeted the following vulnerabilities:

Attackers were especially hungry for remote access systems. As mentioned, operators of 

Sodinokibi ransomware penetrated the infrastructure of British energy company Elexon by 

exploiting vulnerability CVE-2019-11510 in the Pulse Secure VPN server. Operators of Black 

Kingdom ransomware used the same penetration vector in their attack. The Australian 

Cybersecurity Center has released an advisory on attacker tactics and techniques, stating 

that exploitation of vulnerability CVE-2019-19781 in some Citrix products has become a vec-

tor for breaching the networks of government authorities and private companies in Australia. 

The vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to execute arbitrary code and attack re-

sources on a company's internal network.

In Q2, two vulnerabilities discovered by Positive Technologies experts made the headlines. 

This time, the vulnerabilities were found in the Cisco ASA firewall. Vulnerability CVE-2020-

3187 allows an unauthorized attacker to perform DoS attacks against a VPN. The second flaw 

(CVE-2020-3259) allows an intruder to intercept a VPN user's session identifier and access 

a company's internal network. To eliminate the vulnerabilities, update Cisco ASA to the most 

recent version.

Signs of compromise of remote access systems include multiple failed VPN connection at-

tempts, attempts to connect to hosts of critical subsystems from the VPN, enabled RDP ac-

cess on the firewall, and concurrent connections (parallel sessions). To detect such incidents, 

use SIEM systems with fine-tuned security incident correlation rules.

Once information about a severe vulnerability is published, criminals immediately try to exploit 

it. Only a few days after announcement of vulnerability CVE-2020-5902, uncovered by our 

company's  expert  in  the F5 Networks BIG-IP application delivery controller,  hackers  tried  to 

exploit it. The vulnerability has the highest CVSS score. Note that APT groups may also be 

interested in exploiting this flaw, meaning that companies that have not yet installed the vendor 

updates are at risk. To block attacks aimed at exploiting these vulnerabilities, we recommend 

using a web application firewall  (WAF).

Ransomware collaboration
Ransomware is one of the fastest-growing varieties of cybercrime. It has become a common 

practice for attackers to threaten to disclose the stolen data unless the victim pays a ransom. 

Maze and Sodinokibi operators were the most active perpetrators of such attacks in Q2 2020. 

DoppelPaymer, NetWalker, Ako, Nefilim, and Clop are also among the leaders by number of 

cyberextortion attacks. Some of them, like Ako, even implement a "double extortion" scheme 

by demanding separate ransoms for decryption and non-disclosure of data.

To sell the stolen data, many ransomware operators create special data leak sites where they 

publish a list of victims and the stolen information. Others publish the data on hacker forums. 

LockBit and Ragnar Locker went even further, teaming up with the "industry leader" hacking 

group Maze. The Maze operators now publish data stolen by other gangs on their data leak site. 

Together, the gangs have formed the so-called Maze cartel.

However, this is not the only possible collaboration scheme. Ransomware attackers often buy 

access to victim companies' networks from other criminals. The operators of NetWalker are 

recruiting affiliates to spread their ransomware by offering a commission on the ransom.

Figure 25. Ransomware victim categories among organizations 

Despite the need to share the proceeds, ransomware owners are still profiting handsomely. In 

Q2 alone, they reaped millions of U.S. dollars. The University of California San Francisco paid 

$1.14 million in ransom after an attack by NetWalker ransomware. The Sodinokibi ransomware 

group hacked American law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks (GSMS), which represents 

a long list of international celebrities. The ransom, set at $21 million, was not paid. The hackers 

then doubled the ransom and started to offer the data of A-list stars for sale. Criminals claim 

to have a buyer ready for information about Donald Trump. In May, Sodinokibi held an online 

auction of the stolen data, the first lot being documents relating to Madonna.

Ransomware owners are not the only 
ones to demand ransom
Other criminals have quickly caught up with the trend of demanding ransom for non-disclo-

sure. For example, hackers are demanding a ransom from stores in order to not sell the stolen 

data to third parties. The $500 ransom they are asking is relatively modest compared to what 

the Sodinokibi operators are trying to extort. Nevertheless, this business model can offer sig-

nificant profits: database owners are often willing to pay to protect their reputation, while the 

criminals never run out of potential buyers.

Another cybergroup is breaking into LenovoEMC network-attached storage devices, deleting 

files, and demanding ransom of $200 to $275 to restore the data. Similar campaigns hit poorly 

protected MongoDB databases in Q2. Attackers wipe the compromised databases and then, 

just like ransomware operators, frighten victims with the potential of GDPR penalties unless a 

ransom of $140 is paid. Note that even unskilled hackers can perform such attacks by using 

ready-made scripts that allow them to search the Internet for devices with weak passwords or 

without password protection.  It  is therefore vital to ensure secure configuration of your sys-

tems and use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for critical resources

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most important and 

emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our own expertise, outcomes of nu-

merous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.

In our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to reputational risks. The re-

sult is that even organizations that investigate incidents and analyze activity by hacker groups 

are unable to perform a precise count. This research is conducted in order to draw the atten-

tion of companies and ordinary individuals who care about the state of information security 

to the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main trends in the 

changing cyberthreat landscape.

In this report, each mass attack (in which attackers send out a phishing email to many address-

es, for instance) is counted as a single incident. The terminology used in this report can be 

found in our glossary.

For 18 years, Positive Technologies has been creating innovative solutions for information security. We develop products and ser-

vices to detect, verify, and neutralize the real-world business risks associated with corporate IT infrastructure. Our technologies 

are backed by years of research experience and the expertise of world-class cybersecurity experts.

Over 2,000 companies in 30 countries trust us to keep them safe.
