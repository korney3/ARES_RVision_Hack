Trends and forecasts
Positive Technologies keeps monitoring the most important IT security 

threats. Experts all over the world are working to combat cybercriminals, 

fueling an arms race in which hackers continue to refine their tools. In early 

2019, companies in a wide range of industries suffered from cyberattacks.

Summarizing our findings from the first quarter of 2019, we note the follow-

ing trends:

 � The number of unique cyberincidents continued to grow, exceeding the 

equivalent year-ago period (Q1 2018) by 11 percent.

 � Malware combining multiple types of Trojans is becoming more and more 

widespread.  Due to its flexible modular architecture, this malware can per-

form many different functions. For example, it can display advertising and 

steal user data at the same time.

 � The share of hidden mining keeps decreasing (7% compared to 9% in Q4 

2018). Hackers have started to upgrade miners, turning them into multifunc-

tional Trojans. Once inside a system with low computational power on which 

mining is uneconomical, such Trojans start acting as spyware and steal data.

 � Infections by cryptolockers increased from 9 percent of total incidents in 

Q4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. This malware is often used in combina-

tion with phishing, with hackers constantly inventing new ways of deceiv-

ing users and making them pay a ransom.

 � Healthcare has proved to be a favorite target of cryptolockers. Medical 

institutions are more likely to pay a ransom compared to other businesses, 

perhaps because of patients' lives and health being at stake.

 � Cyberattacks against government are mainly aimed at data theft, with at-

tackers using custom self-developed spyware, or at hacking government 

websites in order to infect users with malware.

 � Malware remains a serious threat for large industrial companies. When it 

comes to such companies, the objective of most attacks is to obtain busi-

ness secrets. It is possible that ransomware attacks on industry could be 

aimed at covering the traces of previous incidents.

 � Leaks of millions of user credentials put online services at risk. Attackers 

extensively use publicly available data for credential stuffing attacks.

 � Injection attacks with malicious JavaScript code (JS sniffers) steal payment 

card information and jeopardize the security of users of online stores and 

services that support online payments.

We predict growth in the number of attacks in Q2 2019. Malware and social 

engineering will remain the favored tools of attackers.

It is no secret that cryptocurrency is in high demand by criminals. However, 

mining is becoming increasingly difficult, which is forcing hackers to search for 

alternative ways of obtaining cryptocurrency. As a result, the share of ransom-

ware Trojans will remain high so long as there are people willing to pay a ransom.

Statistics
In the first quarter of 2019, we saw a growing number of attacks aimed at 

obtaining data. In fact, more than half of attacks were aimed at theft of in-

formation.  Attackers chase a wide range of data, including personal cor-

respondence and trade secrets. However, the most in-demand information 

remains credentials, personal data, and payment card data.

Figure 1. Attackers' motives

Figure 2. Types of stolen data

The share of targeted attacks fell from 62 percent in Q4 2018 to 47 percent 

in Q1 2019. This is caused by an increasing number of attacks affecting more 

than one industry—most often, malware campaigns. The share of incidents 

affecting individuals remained almost the same (21% compared to 22% in Q4 

2018). As for organizations, attackers most often hit government agencies, 

medical institutions, industrial companies, banks, and other financial firms. 

Later in this report, we will examine these attacks in detail. In addition, Q1 

2019 saw a growing number of attacks against online services. We will also 

try to explain why hackers are so interested in this particular target.

Attack methods
We will take a closer look at each attack method and indicate which targets 

and industries were most affected.

Malware use

Since the beginning of 2019, we have been observing infections by multi-

functional Trojans—modular malware capable of combining different types 

of functions. For example, the DanaBot Trojan has remote-control compo-

nents, may function as a banking Trojan, and can also steal passwords of a 

number of applications.

Phishing remains an effective way of delivering malware. But email is far 

from the only channel of malware distribution. For example, users frequently 

download files from torrent trackers, on which the risk of malware infection 

grows exponentially. Under the guise of a movie, attackers distributed mal-

ware used for spoofing addresses of bitcoin and Ethereum wallets when the 

information is copied from the clipboard. Users also often download pro-

grams from official app stores. Programs with annoying advertising turn out 

to be the most common source of malware infection.1, 2 Unfortunately, more 

dangerous malware can also be encountered on these stores, such as the 

MobSTSPY and Exodus spyware Trojans, as well as the Anubis and Gustuff 

banking Trojans. The last one is sold on the darknet under the malware- as-a-

service model for $800 per month.

Hidden mining is becoming less popular. In early 2018, the share of mining 

attacks reached 23 percent, but declined to 9 percent in Q4. In Q1 2019, cryp-

tojacking accounted for only 7 percent of attacks. As mining becomes less 

profitable, cybercriminals are forced to upgrade miners by extending their 

capabilities to those of multifunctional Trojans. For example, a new Trojan 

dubbed CookieMiner not only installs a hidden miner on a victim's computer, 

but also steals credentials and payment card information.

Ransomware Trojans, on the contrary, are picking up steam: their share of in-

fections has risen from 9 percent in Q4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. However, 

attackers are now earning less money from "traditional" ransomware. This is 

probably due to the educational efforts of cybersecurity experts urging users 

not to pay a ransom for file recovery. Be that as it might, attackers keep in-

venting new ways to manipulate users. CryptoMix hackers promised to donate 

ransom payments to a children's charity. Another malicious attack hit users 

who for whatever reason were not able to pay ransom in bitcoins. A new ver-

sion of ransomware offers PayPal as a payment option. If users choose to pay 

using PayPal, they are taken to a fake PayPal page. All credentials and pay-

ment information entered on the fake page are then stolen by attackers, who 

can withdraw money from victims' accounts or sell this data on the darkweb. 

Social engineering

Social engineering remains a common method of malware distribution. In 

March, the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) detected 

a mass email campaign distributing a text document regarding upcoming 

presidential elections in Ukraine. The document contained a macro which 

decoded a PowerShell Empire script hidden in metadata. The script was 

used to download malware to the victim's computer.

Besides political events, industry conferences also serve as a subject of 

phishing emails sent by attackers. Our experts discovered an invitation for 

a scientific conference that contained an exploit for vulnerability CVE-2018-

0802 and remote control malware.

Another phishing trick is to ask victims to verify their account. Hackers sent 

messages to the owners of popular Instagram profiles prompting them to 

enter personal data and credentials in fake forms, putting all the submitted 

data into the hands of the hackers. In yet another example, clients of TD Bank 

received emails with the subject line "Confirm account status" pretending 

to come from the bank. The emails contained the TrickBot banking Trojan. 

In both cases, the malicious messages were sent from email addresses that 

closely resembled genuine addresses of the companies.

Savvy Internet users know that one or more scrambled letters in an address 

can be a warning sign indicating a phishing attack. But what if the domain 

matches the legitimate one? Is it absolutely safe to open attachments from 

such messages? As practice shows, this is not the case. In brand impersona-

tion attacks, attackers often use compromised resources or vulnerabilities in 

mail services to send malicious emails while posing as genuine companies. In 

one case, hackers used an insecure SMTP server configuration to distribute 

malware and impersonate DHL in a phishing campaign. Messages were sent 

from support@dhl.com, which caused recipients to let their guard down.

https://mothership.sg/2019/03/scammers-phishing-links-singpost/


In another sophisticated phishing attack, hackers used the SingPost name. 

The attackers sent a malicious link to users' phones in messages allegedly 

coming from the logistics services provider. Hackers managed to send mes-

sages grouped in the same conversation history as SingPost's actual ones, 

which made users less vigilant, just like in the case of DHL.

Hacking

Attackers exploit known and zero-day vulnerabilities in software for various 

purposes. For example, ready-made exploits are often used to deliver hidden 

miners to devices. In Q1 2019, hackers used security flaws in the clusters with 

outdated Elasticsearch versions (CVE-2014-3120, CVE-2015-1427) and exploit-

ed vulnerabilities CVE-2019-6340 in the Drupal CMS and CVE-2019-5736 in 

Docker containers. Attackers also seek escalation of privileges on a system, 

since administrator rights give them a free hand to conduct malicious actions. 

For example, a zero-day vulnerability in the WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin 

allowed attackers to create administrator accounts, modify SMTP options, and 

redirect traffic. The flaw may be used to conduct brand impersonation attacks 

against companies whose sites have been compromised. We have already 

looked into an example of such an attack in the section on social engineering. 

In another privilege escalation attack, hackers exploited two zero-day vulner-

abilities at the same time—one in Google Chrome and the other in Windows 7. 

Google experts discovered the attacks in late February.

Also in February, cybersecurity experts discovered vulnerabilities in WinRAR 

that had existed in the program for around 19 years. Such flaws offer hackers 

new opportunities for infecting victims with malware. In the first month since 

the vulnerability was disclosed, experts have identified about a hundred ex-

ploits for the detected vulnerability. WinRAR is an ubiquitous compression 

tool used by millions of people as well as major companies, making the vul-

nerability immensely attractive for hackers. According to experts, the vulner-

ability threatens 500 million users worldwide. The developers have already 

fixed the bugs and released a new version of the software, but the threat 

remains relevant as WinRAR does not have an automatic update mechanism.

Web attacks

The beginning of the year was marked by mass attacks by the MageCart 

group famous for so-called web skimmers—scripts used to steal payment 

card information from websites. We already discussed these attacks in the 

Q4 2018 report. In January 2019, experts noted a new surge of MageCart 

attacks. The attackers infected 277 e-commerce websites. They managed to 

extend their reach by using supply chain attacks, in which a company is com-

promised in order to attack another one. MageCart hackers injected skim-

ming code into a JavaScript library used by Adverline, an online advertising 

company. As a result, websites of the companies that published advertise-

ments via Adverline were in turn infected. The Media Trust experts registered 

a similar but larger attack. They discovered a malicious campaign compro-

mising tens of adtech vendors and threatening 49 high-profile websites.

When compromising websites, attackers are motivated by more than just 

data theft. A website attack can be an effective way to draw attention to 

a problem. Attackers often hit government websites following significant 

events that have caused public outcry. After a terrorist attack in Pulwama on 

February 14, hundreds of Pakistani websites were hacked.

Sometimes hackers strive to draw public attention to security problems. The 

website of Dublin's tram system operator, Luas, was hacked because the 

website owners did not reply to a message sent by an anonymous hacker 

pointing out security flaws. Developer neglect of security issues likely con-

tributed to an XSS attack targeting users of VK, the popular Russian social 

network, in February 2019.

XSS attacks also threaten users of WordPress websites. A vulnerability in the 

Abandoned Cart plugin allows attackers to create a backdoor, specifically, an 

account with administrator rights. According to experts, the flaw has already 

been exploited by attackers at least 5,000 times. A vulnerability in the Social 

Warfare plugin allows redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites. And 

our company's research shows that XSS attacks are still among the most 

common risks threatening web application users.

Credential compromise

One source of hacker income is selling credentials on the darkweb. The more 

usernames and passwords hackers steal, the more money they get, which in-

spires them to conduct mass bruteforcing attacks. Experts observe a grow-

ing number of attacks aimed at bruteforcing credentials for Office 365 and 

G Suite. Attackers are taking advantage of vulnerabilities in outdated ver-

sions of the IMAP protocol to significantly increase the speed of password 

bruteforcing.

Traces of credential compromise were also found in an attack against Citrix 

that resulted in theft of trade secrets. Experts believe that attackers could 

have used so-called "password spraying" for the attack. This method involves 

trying the same password or handful of passwords for a whole list of user-

names. Unlike traditional bruteforcing, this technique avoids the automatic 

lockouts that would otherwise occur after numerous failed login attempts.

In March 2019, the W3C and FIDO Alliance adopted the WebAuthn pass-

wordless login standard. It is hoped that the new technology will make brute-

forcing and password spraying a thing of the past. However, implementation 

of the standard will take some time.

The beginning of the year offered unpleasant surprises for government in-

stitutions in many countries. A complex but well-planned cyberespionage 

campaign, DNSpionage, started at the end of last year and went on the 

march in January and February 2019. Cybercriminals stole credentials for 

email accounts and other government resources. This classic supply chain 

attack managed to compromise the accounts of two major DNS providers. 

However, the attackers' ultimate targets were government institutions in the 

Middle East. After gaining access to providers' servers, hackers performed a 

DNS hijacking attack, altering DNS records and redirecting all mail and VPN 

traffic to an attacker-controlled server.  The campaign reached such a scale 

that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had to issue an emergency 

directive outlining security measures to be taken by all federal agencies.

Figure 14. DNS hijacking attack scheme

Early January was also marked by the resurgence of the DarkHydrus APT 

group. The group targets government institutions, mainly in the Middle East, 

and distributes an updated version of the RogueRobin Trojan (developed by 

the group itself). The updated malware version can communicate with the 

C2 server via the Google Drive API.

As before, attackers keep hitting high-traffic government websites and in-

fecting them with malware. In one such case, hackers posted links to ma-

licious Word documents with the Godzilla loader on the website of the 

Bangladesh embassy in Cairo.

A Pakistani government site was infected by malware. The website in ques-

tion allows users to apply for a Pakistani passport and track the status of 

their application. The Scanbox JavaScript framework collected all the data 

submitted by visitors and sent it to criminals.

Q1 2019 also saw a number of ransomware attacks on government institutions. 

In most cases, the encrypted files were recovered from backups. However, of-

ficials in Jackson County, Georgia, paid $400,000 to restore IT infrastructure.

Healthcare attacks mostly involved malware infection and theft of em-

ployee credentials, which remain the two most common attack methods 

against medical institutions. For example, email accounts of Verity Medical 

Foundation employees were hacked three times within several months.

Healthcare is a favorite target of ransomware attacks for several reasons. 

Medical institutions often do not have an adequate information security 

budget. Weak protection makes hospitals easy prey for hackers. Moreover, 

healthcare facilities store and process huge amounts of personal data, in-

cluding patients' diagnoses. Hospitals risk substantial fines for losing these 

databases, which forces them to pay ransoms more willingly than other busi-

nesses. Columbia Surgical Specialists preferred not to risk patients' data and 

paid $15,000 for file recovery.

New LockerGoga ransomware is attacking major engineering and industrial 

companies. The virus gained public attention in January in an attack against 

Altran Technologies, a French engineering consulting firm. Just a month later, 

Norwegian aluminum company Norsk Hydro had to halt operations due to 

a similar cyberattack. The ransomware victims also included two American 

chemical companies. Security experts are actively studying the infamous 

malware and have already uncovered a coding error that could be used to 

stop the spread of the virus. However, victory is a long way off: to date, ex-

perts have identified 31 samples of this rapidly developing ransomware.

The Cobalt group did not give up ground either. In Q1 2019, hackers used the 

same technique they applied in late 2018. Just like before, attacks involved 

COM-DLL-Dropper loaded with an obfuscated JavaScript backdoor.

In February, PT ESC detected an attack that involved the use of Metasploit in 

conjunction with COM-DLL-Dropper. The Metasploit stager is loaded into the 

memory of an infected computer from an attacker-controlled server, provid-

ing remote access to the device and downloading the necessary Metasploit

modules. A similar attack was conducted in last October and December by 

an unknown group—a fact we already covered in our previous report.

A bank cyberattack may lead to infrastructure downtime costing tens and 

sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. In February, Malta's Bank of 

Valletta shut down operations as the result of a cyberattack. Hackers tried 

to steal €13 million, but the attack was discovered and stopped just in time.

Active Internet users constantly interact with various online services by com-

municating on social networks, playing games, watching movies, buying 

tickets, and booking hotel rooms. However, these services also attract hacker 

attention, as they store huge amounts of data, including of a personal nature, 

that can bring large profits if sold.

Today, one of the most popular methods of hacking is credential stuffing, 

when hackers try to log in to a service with credentials used for other online 

services. In January, Reddit announced hacker attempts to obtain unauthor-

ized access to users' accounts, and had to lock down the affected accounts. 

According to the Reddit owners, the attackers could have been trying to 

make use of large-scale password leaks. Video sharing platform DailyMotion 

also fell victim to a credential stuffing attack. But where do hackers get the 

databases of credentials needed to conduct such attacks? The darkweb is 

one such place. Data for 620 million accounts stolen from 16 hacked ma-

jor websites, including popular online services, was put on sale on Dream 

Market, a darkweb marketplace.

However, attackers can have other objectives as well. VFEmail, an email pro-

vider, was completely destroyed in a cyberattack in February 2019. The at-

tackers formatted all disks on every server, as a result of which even backups 

were lost. The attack can be explained by high competition on the market 

and the struggle for customers.

What companies can do to stay safe

Use proven security solutions:

 � Systems for centralized administration of updates and patches. To prior-

itize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats must be 

taken into account.

 � Antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and the 

ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments 

before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should si-

multaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability 

to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious 

activity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file 

storage, and web portals. The solution must not only check files in real time, 

but also automatically analyze files that have already been checked; this 

will allow detecting new threats when signature databases are updated.

 � We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effec-

tive response to information security incidents. This will help identify sus-

picious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence, 

and enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.

 � Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.

 � Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.

 � Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to de-

tect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Previously 

unnoticed attacks are detected. Monitoring shows network attacks in real 

time, including use of malware and hacking tools, exploitation of software 

vulnerabilities, and attacks on the domain controller. Such an approach 

quickly identifies attackers' presence in infrastructure, minimizes the risk of 

loss of critical data and disruption to business systems, and decreases the 

financial damage caused by attackers.

 � Use specialized anti-DDoS services.

Protect your data:

 � Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where 

it can be publicly accessed.

 � Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are iso-

lated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.

 � Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.

 � Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple 

systems.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged 

accounts.

Do not allow weak passwords:

 � Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.

 � Require password changes every 90 days.

 � Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

20

Cybersecurity threatscape:
Q1 2019



Keep clients in mind:

 � Improve security awareness among clients.

 � Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common 

attacks.

 � Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not 

give out such information by email or over the phone.

 � Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.

 � Inform of security-related events.

Do not allow weak passwords:

 � Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.

 � Require password changes every 90 days.

 � Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

Monitor and stay current:

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

 � Test and educate employees regarding information security.

 � Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perim-

eter. Regularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check 

their security, and remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea 

to monitor the news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in 

identifying affected resources and applying necessary patches.

 � Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces acces-

sible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote 

management of servers and network equipment. 

 � Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking 

internal infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.

 � Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code 

analysis, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application sys-

tems and clients at risk of attack.

 � Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources. 

Configure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack sce-

narios (such as TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).

How vendors can secure their products
 � All of the measures for companies given above, plus:

 � Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).

 � Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including 

source-code analysis.

 � Keep web servers and database software up to date. 

 � Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

21



How users can avoid falling victim
Invest in security:

 � Use only licensed software. 

 � Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches. 

Protect your data:

 � Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a 

copy on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.

 � Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.

Do not use weak passwords:

 � Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, 

numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to 

create and securely store passwords.

 � Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that 

you use.

 � Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every 

two to three months.

Be vigilant:

 � Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.

 � Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that in-

formation entered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.

 � Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.

 � Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warn-

ing appears. 

 � Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or 

product being advertised.

 � Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most 

important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our 

own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from author-

itative sources.

Any particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware, is 

considered in this report as a single unique information security threat. Each 

event is characterized by the following parameters:

 � Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. For 

example, if an attack strikes network equipment, servers, or user worksta-

tions, the attack target is "infrastructure."

 � Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in 

theft of payment card information, the motive is "access to information."

 � Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An attacker 

can perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services availa-

ble for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to resources or 

information. For the purposes of this report, this process is referred to as 

"hacking." Credential compromise and web attacks are put in separate cat-

egories for greater granularity.

 � Victim category is the economic sector in which the attacked companies 

operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For example, the 

"Hospitality and entertainment" category includes companies providing 

paid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and restaurants. The 

"Online services" category includes platforms where users can fulfill their 

needs online, for example ticket and hotel aggregator websites, blogs, so-

cial networks, chat platforms and other social media resources, video shar-

ing platforms, and online games. Large-scale cyberattacks affecting more 

than one industry (most often, malware outbreaks) have been placed in 

the "Multiple industries" category.

We believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because 

of reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in 

incident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the pre-

cise number of threats. This research was conducted in order to educate 

companies and individuals who care about information security on the most 

common motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the 

main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.
