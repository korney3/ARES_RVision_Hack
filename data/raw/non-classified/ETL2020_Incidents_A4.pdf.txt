ENISA ETL2020 - Main Incidents in the EU and Worldwide


From January 2019 to April 2020

Main 
incidents in 
the EU and 
worldwide
ENISA Threat Landscape



2

Overview

The sophistication of threat capabilities increased in 2019, with 

many adversaries using exploits, credential stealing, and multi-

stage attacks. The number of data breach incidents is still very high, 

and the amount of stolen financial information and user credentials is 

growing. In some cases, the failure to patch a known vulnerability that 

has the potential to affect software or libraries in use - in a reasonable 

timeframe – may have serious repercussions. 

During the past decade, malware has made ENISA’s list of top 15 

threats, yet still many security systems are not able to detect this 

threat. For many years, malware was spread mainly through malicious 

e-mail spam and more recently, using finely crafted phishing messages. 

Technology companies and e-mail providers alike invested in spam 

filters, improving the detection of malicious attachments. However, 

adversaries are now innovating to increase their chances of 

reaching potential victims. Many of these innovations have paid back 

to malicious actors during this period.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare organisations and 

professionals worldwide under pressure, and health has become one of 

the most critical sectors to protect against cyberattacks. The number of 

incidents involving ransomware targeting the healthcare sector was 

already high but increased during the pandemic.

Most targeted sectors

The sectors most targeted sectors during this period were digital 

services, government administration and the technology industry. 

Attacks on digital service providers often serve as proxies to reach other, 

more attractive targets. In contrast, attacks on the technology industry 

allowed malicious actors to compromise the supply chain or look for 

vulnerabilities to exploit.

The e-mail platform verifications.io18, suffered a major data breach due 

to an unprotected MongoDB database. Data from over 800 million e-

mails were exposed, containing sensitive information that included 

personally identifiable information (PII). 

Over 770 million e-mail addresses and 21 million unique passwords 

were exposed in a popular hacking forum hosted by the cloud service 

MEGA1. It became the most significant collection of breached personal 

credentials in history, named ‘Collection #1’. 

The cloud and virtualisation provider Citrix was a victim of a targeted 

cyberattack. To gain access to Citrix’s systems, the attackers exploited 

several critical software vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-19781 and 

employed a technique called password spraying. 

The cloud hosting provider iNSYNQ19 experienced a ransomware attack 

that left customers unable to access their data for more than a week, 

forcing customers to rely on local backups.

__Most targeted sectors

Digital Services_ Services such as e-mail, social and 
collaborative platforms and cloud providers were under attack 

during 2019. These were also used as proxies for further attacks.

Government Administration_ The financial 
returns from ransoms paid makes the public sector one of the 

most attractive targets for ransomware attacks.

Technology Industry_ The technology industry 
was under attack in 2019 mainly through supply chain attacks 

trying to compromise the development of software through zero-

day exploits and backdoors attacks.

Financial_ The number of incidents with financial 
organisations and not necessarily banks, increased substantially 

during the reporting period. 

Healthcare_ The number of attacks against the 
healthcare sector continues to grow.

_Across the board

 In 2019, intense trojan-activity was observed across the globe. 

Emotet and Agent Tesla were the most frequently and dangerous 

malwares .

 Phishing remained one of the most successful techniques for 

delivering malicious tools. Powerful phishing lures include phone 

scams, fake invoices, payments, quotations and purchase and sales 

orders. 

 Ransomware continues to generate substantial financial rewards for 

malicious actors. A recent study identified human-operated 

ransomware campaigns17, in which adversaries employ credential 

theft and lateral movement methods traditionally associated with 

targeted attacks such as those from nation-state actors.

 Card-skimming schemes have become a significant threat during 

2019 and 2020 due to the increasing number of online shoppers. 

 Business e-mail compromise (BEC) is a growing threat as a result of 

the vast amount of credentials and personal information stolen 

during the last decade.

 Companies experience an average of 12 credential-stuffing attacks 

each month, wherein the attacker is able to identify valid credentials.

Actors

Knowing who is responsible or attributing responsibilities to a person or 

a group for a cybersecurity incident is still a very daunting task and often 

a worthless exercise. Yet, from a threat intelligence perspective, it is 

essential to classify behaviours, understand the dynamics and modus 

operandi used by certain adversaries. This analysis often helps 

defenders to look for specific tracks and try to anticipate the next 

adversarial action.

The Lazarus Group for example, an allegedly state-sponsored advanced 

persistent threat (APT) group, was reportedly more active during the 

reporting period in both financially and espionage motivated attacks. 

The group has been associated with several incidents, including the 

AppleJeus campaign targeting cryptocurrency trading platform users 

and their systems.22 Major incidents attributed to this group include:

 hacking an Indian nuclear power plant and space research 

organisation in November 2019;

 compromising a cryptocurrency trading app targeting exchange 

administrators in October 2019;

 attacking automated teller machines (ATMs) and banks in India, 

identified in September 2019;

 targeting Android users in South Korea through trojanised apps in the 

Google Play Store identified in August 2019.

Motivations

While it is challenging to determine the primary motivation behind a 

cyberattack, we can still categorise them based on the outcome of the 

incident. 

Financial: The number of incidents resulting in the theft of information, 

data and user credentials is the highest observed during the reporting 

period. In most cases, the intention is to steal data/information and sell 

it on the dark web. Other uses of this information/data to enable other 

types of attacks with a completely different outcome such as espionage 

or financial fraud, can also be identified. More than 620 million account 

details were stolen from 16 hacked websites and offered for sale on the 

popular dark-web marketplace Dream Market.

Espionage: This is a motive behind an increasing number of reported 

attacks, mainly due to ongoing geopolitical and commercial tensions. 

The number of incidents is not substantial, but their size and magnitude 

put it second in ENISA’s list of top 5 motivations. Some noteworthy 

incidents include that reported in April 2019, in which a General Electric’s 

employee and a Chinese businessperson were charged by the United 

States Department of Justice with economic espionage and theft of 

General Electric’s trade secrets.20 AgenceFrance Presse (AFP) reported 

that Airbus had fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber-espionage 

campaign. Attackers reportedly breached the IT systems of several of 

Airbus’s suppliers and, from there, penetrated the company’s IT 

systems.21

Top five motivations: financial, espionage, disruption, 

political and retaliation.

__Top motivations

The figure below shows that Financial is still the primary motive 

for the majority of cyberattacks. In some cases, multiple 

motivations can be identified within a single attack. For example, 

espionage, political, financial and disruption are often combined 

motives. Many incidents originate from automated systems and 

are delivered ‘as-a-service’, paid in cryptocurrency. These services 

include distribution of ransomware, command and control (C2), 

distributed denial of service (DDoS), spam and other illicit 

activities.



14

Attack vectors

_How

Cyberattacks take on average three steps to reach a victim’s valuable 

assets. When reviewing the most frequently used attack vectors, we 

must prioritise the entry point, course of action and action on assets. 

These are the most critical stages that should constitute distinct 

approaches in a defence strategy. 

Entry point: During 2019, the techniques used most frequently to start 

a cyberattack include brute force with stolen credentials, social 

engineering, configuration errors and exploitation of web applications. 

The exploitation of web applications, for example, was often used as an 

entry point because of the growing uptake of this type of application to 

transfer data to the cloud. Errors in cloud configuration and misuse of 

systems were essential entry point in a large number of incidents. The 

use of social engineering to plan an attack leverages from tools such as 

phishing and business e-mail compromise (BEC)16. Other techniques less 

frequently but equally important are the exploitation of vulnerabilities 

(from unpatched systems and zero-days) and software backdoors, often 

used in more complex and sophisticated attacks.

Course of action: Installing malware is the technique most widely used 

during the ‘course of action’ stage. Once installed, it helps the adversary 

to do reconnaissance, move around the victim’s systems and networks, 

install additional tools such as ransomware, steal data and communicate 

with a C2 server.



15

__Fivemost desired assets by 
cybercriminals

01_Industrial property and trade secrets
Industrial property and trade secrets are the most desirable assets 

because of their high value to their owners, the market and some cases 

the criminal world.

02_State/military classified information
This asset includes any information that a state deems sensitive. In 

2019, the trade and diplomatic tensions between countries made this 

type of information even more attractive.

03_Server infrastructure
Server infrastructure is the first sensitive asset that is not data. In many 

attacks, taking over the victim’s server infrastructure, is the primary 

objective.

04_Authentication data
Authentication data is valuable assets for generating profits but also as 

an objective to support an attack.

05_Financial data
Financial data such as credit card, banking and payment information 

is always value to cybercriminals.



16

Strategic intelligence

_What changed in the landscape with the 
covid-19 pandemic?

In 2019, ENISA continued mapping the threat landscape, helping 

decision-makers and policymakers define strategies to defend citizens, 

organisations and cyberspace. This work is part of ENISA’s strategy to 

provide strategic intelligence to its stakeholders. The central theme in 

2019 was the next generation of mobile telecommunications, or 5G, 

following a request from the European Commission and Member States. 

The agency will continue to produce these thematic threat 

landscapes and in 2020, the focus is on artificial intelligence. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a prolific period for malicious actors 

conducting attacks targeting sensitive areas such as healthcare service 

providers and people working from home. ENISA is mapping the threat 

landscape experienced during the pandemic and advising on mitigation 

measures that will attempt to reduce the exposure to threats. 

ENISA shares its cybersecurity recommendations on the COVID-19 

pandemic on a variety of topics including working remotely, online 

shopping and e-health, and it provides valuable up to date security 

advice to the sectors affected.32

The Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic suffered a 

cyberattack33 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to 

reroute patients and postpone surgery. The incident is considered 

critical since this Hospital is one of the Czech Republic's biggest COVID-

19 testing laboratories.



17

_COVID-19 threat landscape

ENISA prepared many resources for an awareness-raising campaign and 

shared other internal and external resources dedicated to cybersecurity 

experts, covering security issues associated with challenges faced during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. One of these resources was an analysis of the 

most critical threats during this period.
