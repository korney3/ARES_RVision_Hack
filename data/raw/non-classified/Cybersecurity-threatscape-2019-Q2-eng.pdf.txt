What is a cyberthreat?
As computers have permeated all aspects of life, the benefits have 

been immense for many areas of the economy, including finance, 

retail, industry, healthcare, education, and science. Today, business 

and government policy alike are difficult to imagine without informa-

tion technologies. But criminals have learned to use these systems 

for unlawful purposes. The result is a constant battle between cyber-

outlaws and security professionals. To survive, criminals constantly 

refine their methods and tools, leaving greater numbers of digital 

threats in their wake.

By cyberthreat, we refer to a confluence of factors and conditions 

with the potential to compromise information security. In this report, 

we will consider cyberthreats from the standpoint of the actions per-

formed by criminals in cyberspace with the intention to breach an 

information system for stealing data or money, or performing other 

acts with the potential to cause harm to governments, businesses, or 

individuals. Criminals may pursue these aims by targeting corporate 

IT infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other software and 

equipment, or humans themselves.

Trends and forecasts
Positive Technologies keeps monitoring the most important IT se-

curity threats. Cybercriminals are not slackening: they seize on news 

of fresh vulnerabilities, react to cryptocurrency price changes, and 

continue to refine their techniques.

Summarizing our findings from the second quarter of 2019, we 

note the following trends:

 � The number of unique cyberincidents remains high, standing at 

three percent higher than in Q1 2019.

 � Mass attacks are less common than targeted ones, which make 

up 59 percent of the total (12% higher than in Q1).

 � Over half of all cybercrimes have data theft as their goal. Direct 

financial gain motivated 42 percent of attacks on individuals and 

30 percent of attacks on organizations.

 � In attacks on organizations, most stolen information consisted of 

personal data (29%). Individuals stood to lose their credentials 

and payment card information (44% and 34%, respectively, of all 

information stolen from individuals).

 � Growth in the value of Bitcoin has inspired a revival of hidden 

mining. 

 � MageCart attacks are becoming more common. Experts have 

noted the increased presence of JS sniffers even on sites that do 

not handle payments.

 � Malware infections have become more common among govern-

ment targets (62% compared to 44% in Q1 2019). Last quarter, 

governments most frequently were hit by ransomware.

 � IT companies often serve as a stepping-stone in supply chain at-

tacks. Email addresses from hacked IT vendors are actively used 

by attackers in phishing messages.

Statistics
As in past quarters, data theft is the top goal of most cyberattacks. Direct financial gain, by contrast, is 

sought in 30 percent of attacks on organizations and in 42 percent of attacks on individuals. The high 

rate of financially motivated attacks on individuals owes to several factors: regular mass infections by 

adware (including on mobile devices), infection by miners and other malware on dubious sites, and ex-

tortion campaigns in which the victim is threatened with compromising information.

Personal data and credentials are the most frequent item of interest for attackers targeting organizations. 

This is no surprise, since companies can keep huge databases of clients' personal data and credentials. In 

addition, attackers may be interested in the credentials of the employees of the victim company.

Social media accounts can also be of value to an attacker, especially if an account is highly popular with a 

large number of subscribers. At the same time, users often fail to take basic precautions for securing their 

accounts. They use weak passwords or re-use passwords across sites, enter their passwords without mak-

ing sure of site authenticity, and give out information that could help to guess their password. These factors 

explain the high rate of stolen credentials (44%) among attacks on individuals. For instance, computer 

game fans form a high-risk category. In Q2, attackers lured Steam users to websites with the false promise 

of a free new game, as long as the users would enter their Steam credentials first. Similar ruses can also be 

found on gaming forums. A number of websites distributed the TurtleCoin cryptocurrency mining Trojan, 

which was disguised as a ZIP file supposedly containing cheat codes.

Since payment cards and financial details are usually protected cryptographically, attackers' method of 

least resistance is to trick people into disclosing this information via social engineering. Among attacks 

on individuals, 34 percent of stolen data consists of payment card information.

In Q2 2019, the share of targeted 

attacks climbed significantly com-

pared to the previous quarter (59% 

in Q2 vs. 47% in Q1). The share of 

cyberincidents targeting individuals 

was 24 percent. Among organiza-

tions (see Figure 3), the most fre-

quent targets were governments, 

industrial companies, healthcare in-

stitutions, banks, and other financial 

entities. In Q2 we saw supply chain 

attacks on major IT companies with 

clients in a variety of sectors, merit-

ing a closer look in our discussion of 

IT attacks.

Attack methods
We will take a closer look at each attack method and indicate which targets and industries were most 

affected.

Malware use

Multifunctional Trojans constitute a growing share of attacks. For example, the DanaBot modular Trojan 

we wrote about in Q1 now has ransomware capabilities. By comparison, another well-known piece of 

ransomware, GandCrab, wound down and its operators announced the end of the malicious campaign. 

Several weeks after reports indicated the end of development of the ransomware, security researchers 

disclosed they had obtained access to the GandCrab servers. With the help of the encryption keys 

stored there, it was possible to make a decryption program for the latest version of GandCrab so that 

victims could recover their encrypted files.

Despite these events, the rate of ransomware attacks remains high. Creating a simple strain of ransom-

ware does not even require custom code development. Most new ransomware is very similar to what al-

ready exists. Instead of developing code from scratch, cybercriminals can now just acquire ready-to-use 

code or pay for a subscription (ransomware as a service) on the darkweb. So even with minimal upfront 

investment, ransomware can bring a sizable income. 

Reports have periodically appeared since April 2019 of attacks by new Sodinokibi ransomware. At least 

three IT service providers have fallen victim to it. Cybercriminals have used remote administration tools 

(Webroot and Kaseya) to install ransomware on the systems of clients of the compromised IT service 

providers. But Sodinokibi has a few other tricks up its sleeve, in addition to supply chain attacks. It also 

is spread via vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic Server and in phishing messages.

 Email continues to be the most popular method for delivering malware. In Q2, experts noticed an uptick 

in cases of Trojans being spread in the ISO disk image format. This trick has been used by AgentTesla, 

LokiBot, and NanoCore. ISO images are often not scanned by antivirus software, since they may be 

whitelisted. One giveaway is the file size: a malicious disk image will be smaller than 2 megabytes, while 

a legitimate one will usually be much larger.

Figure 9. Malware distribution methods

Figure 10. Theft of Office 365 credentials with use of Azure Blob Storage

We saw renewed criminal interest in cryptojacking in Q2 2019. With the Bitcoin price rising steadily, at-

tackers continue to develop software for stealthy mining. Researchers at Sucuri discovered a miner with 

improved persistence mechanisms: a special cron job (which is run periodically according to a schedule) 

allows resuming mining even if the main malware module has been detected and removed from the 

infected system.

Attackers widely distributed the AZORult infostealer in the second quarter. For instance, the experts at 

the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) in early April noted that the RTM group had 

started using AZORult instead of Pony. In addition, the AZORult Trojan spreads via websites under the 

guise of various utilities (such as the G-Cleaner system optimizer or Pirate Chick VPN client).

Social engineering

In Q2, criminals made active use of Azure App Service for different types of fraud involving social en-

gineering. Azure can be used for quickly deploying phishing pages with fake login forms, as well as for 

creating fake Microsoft technical support pages with popups stating the visitor's computer has been 

infected by a non-existent virus. In addition, attackers send emails prompting to download a file after 

logging in via a fake form, which is hosted on Azure Blob Storage. The scale and success of this scam is 

caused in part by the domain (windows.net) and valid SSL certificate (belonging to Microsoft). But such 

scams are hardly new. Instructions are available to users with the details of how to automatically block 

such phishing emails.

As noted already, the strong increase in Bitcoin value in Q2 sparked a return of interest in the cryptocur-

rency, including among the criminal community. In one iteration, fraudsters used a seemingly timeless 

scheme. They claimed to be famous people or organizations offering cash prizes, with a catch: the "win-

ner" must first transfer a small amount of money for verification purposes. In this case, the cryptocurren-

cy "prizes" were supposedly being handed out by John McAfee and Elon Musk. 

YouTube's popularity has made video channels an attractive place to put malicious links. In one fraud 

campaign, viewers were shown links (in the video description) to materials allegedly teaching how to 

generate bitcoins for free. But in reality, clicking the link initiated download of the Qulab infostealer. 

Another such campaign used YouTube to spread the njRAT Trojan.

Hacking

Hackers are making use of a vulnerability in the Exim mail server (CVE-2019-10149) to remotely run OS 

commands with administrator privileges. One criminal group uses the vulnerability to place a backdoor 

on target systems, by downloading shell scripts to mail servers and adding an SSH key to the root ac-

count. In addition, criminals illegally install cryptocurrency miners on vulnerable servers. The vulnerabili-

ty was fixed by the Exim developers in February 2019. But release of a vendor update often fails to solve 

the problem outright. Delays in installing updates give hackers a chance to successfully exploit even 

vulnerabilities that are five years old.

Throughout Q2, attackers searched for publicly available Docker API instances by scanning the Internet 

for hosts with open port 2375. Misconfigured Docker containers are used for a wide array of purposes. 

After discovering a working container, for example, hackers might install Dofloo on it. This is the same 

Trojan placed by attackers on systems running Atlassian Confluence. To do so, they exploit vulnerability 

CVE-2019-3396. Dofloo uses the victim's resources to perform DDoS attacks and hidden cryptocurren-

cy mining.

Web attacks

In Q2, web vulnerabilities were exploited in 18 percent of attacks on organizations. The wave since Q1 

of attacks on payment sites continues to build. MageCart attacks with JS sniffers (malicious scripts de-

signed to steal payment card information) hit Forbes, Puma, and numerous online stores. The criminals 

regularly update their malicious scripts. The danger of JS sniffers is that the threat may stay unnoticed 

by users, since the malicious scripts are invisible to them. But one of the new methods used by MageCart 

to steal data may offer a way for attentive users to spot the threat. The attackers inject a form for enter-

ing card information into site pages. But normally this interface should be shown only after the user is 

redirected to the secure page of the payment provider. Entering card information twice (first on the site 

itself and a second time on the payment provider's page) should raise red flags among users.

The most discussed security issue of Q2 was BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708), a critical  

Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the RDS service in older versions of Windows. 

Although Microsoft released a patch on May 14, many computers around the world remain at 

risk. Attackers are actively probing for vulnerable hosts and developing exploits.

BlueKeep could be exploited to spread malware on the scale of WannaCry,  

which is why installing Windows updates is so important

Figure 11. MageCart form for stealing payment card information

In Q2, Malwarebytes Labs discovered MageCart JS sniffers in libraries stored by site developers in private 

Amazon CloudFront CDN repositories. In addition, since April criminals have been injecting MageCart 

sniffers into files on Amazon S3, leading to compromise of 17,000 sites. Since not all compromised sites 

show a form for entering card information, experts gauge it likely that the hackers are using JS sniffers 

for so-called mass spray and pray attacks.

Not all of the sites targeted are used for online purchases. In June, the Social Engineered blog, devel-

oped on MyBB, was hacked. Attackers took advantage of an XSS vulnerability in MyBB that had become 

public several days prior. The attackers thus were able to obtain 55,000 sets of credentials and personal 

messages of forum users.

Credential compromise

Weak passwords remain a major security threat. Passwords for 300 employees of Ethiopia's Information 

Network Security Agency, charged with overseeing information security, proved to be weak and were 

subsequently hacked and posted online. Out of 300 passwords, 142 were "p@$$w0rd" and another 60 

were "123".

Credential stuffing (attempts to log in to a system using sets of credentials stolen elsewhere) remains 

frequent. Such attacks resulted in the breach of around half a million user accounts for the Uniqlo and 

GU online stores.

Q2 also marked attacks by the new GoldBrute botnet to bruteforce RDP passwords. Over 1.5 million 

Windows devices have already been attacked. While the objectives of the attackers remain unclear, 

they likely include selling the stolen credentials on the darkweb. Mass attacks on weak credentials are a 

common occurrence for IoT devices as well. Silex malware, which attempts to log in to IoT devices using 

standard sets of credentials, made the news in June. As soon as Silex successfully guesses a password, 

it disables the device. Over 2,000 devices have incurred Silex's destructive power so far.

Here we will consider attacks on specific 

industries of interest during Q2 2019.

Government

In Q2 2019, we saw a sharp rise in the share of malware in attacks on government organizations (62% in 

Q2 vs. 44% in Q1).

Figure 12. Government: attack methods used in Q2 2019

Figure 13. Attack targets Figure 14. Data stolen

Most frequently, governments fall victim to ransomware. In the U.S. in early May, the entire IT infrastruc-

ture of Baltimore was inoperative for several weeks due to RobinHood ransomware. City authorities 

estimated losses at over $18 million.  Baltimore was not RobinHood's first victim: in April, the same ran-

somware infected the systems of the city of Greenville, also in the U.S. 

Faced with the threat of an entire city government's IT systems going down, authorities in several cases 

have had to give in to demands and pay a ransom. This is particularly the case in small cities with poor-

ly developed IT infrastructure. The city council of Riviera Beach, Florida, unanimously voted to pay a 

ransom of 65 bitcoins (approximately $600,000) since the city lacked the backups necessary to get its 

systems running again.

Another Florida city, Lake City, was targeted by ransomware in early June. City information systems were 

infected as part of the large Triple Threat malicious campaign first described in April by Cybereason. 

The Triple Threat campaign received its name because of its three-part payload: phishing messages 

delivered three different Trojans (Emotet, TrickBot, and Ryuk) to victim computers. Although infected 

devices were disconnected from the city network as soon as possible, this was not fast enough to save 

most phone and mail systems. Lake City decided to meet the attackers' demand of 42 bitcoins (approx-

imately $530,000), after which the city's IT director was fired.

Yet another Florida city, Key Biscayne, came in the sights of ransomware attackers in late June. But in 

this case the city refused to pay up. 

Governments have suffered due to phishing as well. In one such attack in Canada, the city of Burlington 

lost $503,000.

Government-related websites continue to attract ill-wishers. A hack of three websites of the FBI National 

Academy Association resulted in posting of personal data for around 4,000 federal agents and law en-

forcement personnel online.

Figure 16. Attack targets Figure 17. Data stolen

Almost all Q2 2019 attacks on industrial companies (96%) involved use of malware. The RTM group is 

actively attempting to penetrate the internal IT infrastructure of industrial companies. PT ESC detected 

26 malicious mailings by the group during the second quarter. Recipients included financial institutions 

and over a dozen industrial entities in Russia and the CIS. All the messages were written in Russian and 

tend to have a financial focus, claiming to include invoices, accounting paperwork, or related documents, 

requesting to verify the documents, sign them, or make payment. 

The RTM Trojan is classified as spyware: it steals credentials, records video, takes screenshots, and exfil-

trates them to the attackers' server. Of interest, in June the group changed the method for getting the 

IP address of its command-and-control (C2) server. Now the address is obtained with the help of logic 

operations (AND and a right rotation) on the amount of a transaction received by a certain Bitcoin wallet.

Ransomware continues its assault on industry. Two such victims in Q2 included Aebi Schmidt, manufac-

turer of equipment for airports, and ASCO, a major aviation parts supplier.

Hackers frequently target the websites of industrial companies. Attackers placed the Emotet Trojan on 

the website of Uniden. The site of Petrobangla, an oil and gas company, was hacked twice in the same 

day. In the latter case, the attacker claimed to be pointing out security issues to the site owners.

Figure 19. Attack targets Figure 20. Data stolen

Business-disrupting malware is especially dangerous in the healthcare sector: such incidents have the 

potential to cause major harm to both institutions and patients. In April 2019, ransomware struck JFJ 

Eyecare, encrypting the personal data of patients. 

Healthcare employees are the frequent victims of phishing attacks. One healthcare employee in Nova 

Scotia (Canada) fell for a message, supposedly from an IT department employee, requesting to send 

account credentials to prevent a freeze. The attacker succeeded in getting the employee's username 

and password, putting data for 3,000 patients at risk.

When targeting healthcare organizations, attackers can be interested not only in patients, but in em-

ployees as well. For example, for $500, it is possible on the darkweb to purchase sets of physician iden-

tity documents: medical diplomas, board recommendations, and medical licenses.

Figure 22. Attack targets Figure 23. Data stolen

Several groups targeted financial institutions in phishing mailings in Q2. The Cobalt group continues its 

attacks, of which PT ESC noted two in the outgoing quarter. In the second attack, the group switched 

from tools it had used since late last year (COM-DLL-Dropper and a JavaScript backdoor) to using a 

modified version of CobInt, which had been in their arsenal already from August to November 2018.

In June, PT ESC detected a phishing mailing from the Silence group disguised as being from a bank 

client.

In May, PT ESC discovered phishing messages with encrypted archives containing an LNK file. When run 

on the victim's computer, the LNK file downloads a PowerShell script, which collects system information 

and sends it to the attackers. Based on this, the attackers chose which malware to install on the compro-

mised computer. Network infrastructure allows us to identify this criminal group as FinTeam.

In Bangladesh, at least three banks were struck by hackers in Q2 2019: Dutch Bangla Bank Limited 

(DBBL), NCC Bank, and Prime Bank. According to reports, the cyberattack on DBBL resulted in losses 

of $3 million. Representatives of the other two banks reported no financial losses.

Figure 24. IT: attack methods used in Q2 2019

Figure 25. Attack targets Figure 26. Data stolen

In the first half of April, vulnerabilities in an out-of-date Jenkins version yielded access to the infrastruc-

ture of Matrix, the decentralized messaging platform developer. Attackers' haul included unencrypted 

messages, hashes of user passwords, and access tokens.

IT companies are frequent victims of supply chain attacks. Hackers broke into the systems of Wipro, one 

of the largest Indian IT service providers with clients in the healthcare, telecom, and finance industries. 

As the result of successful phishing attacks on Wipro infrastructure, over a dozen of the company's cli-

ents received emails (seemingly sent by Wipro employees) with malicious attachments. According to 

Flashpoint, which performed investigation of the incident, one of the motivations for the attackers was 

gift card fraud.

In mid-May, a supply chain attack hit cloud provider PCM. The attackers obtained access to the adminis-

trator account used at PCM to manage clients' Office 365 accounts. In this case, too, the motivation for 

the theft included gift card fraud.

What companies can do to stay safe

Use proven security solutions

 � Implement a system for centralized management of updates and patch-

es. To prioritize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats 

must be taken into account.

 � Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files 

and the ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email at-

tachments before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus soft-

ware should simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and 

have the ability to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well 

as block malicious activity across diverse data streams: email, web traf-

fic, network traffic, file storage, and web portals. The solution must not 

only check files in real time, but also automatically analyze files that have 

already been checked; this will allow detecting new threats when signa-

ture databases are updated.

 � We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and ef-

fective response to information security incidents. This will help identi-

fy suspicious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' 

presence, and enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.

 � Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.

 � Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.

 � Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to 

detect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Using 

such solutions will allow you to detect previously unnoticed attacks and 

monitor network attacks in real time, including use of malware and hack-

ing tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and attacks on the do-

main controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attackers' presence 

in the infrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and disrup-

tion to business systems, and decreases the financial damage caused by 

the attackers.

 � Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.

Protect your data

 � Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information 

where it can be publicly accessed.

 � Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are 

isolated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.

 � Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.

 � Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple 

systems.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged 

accounts.

20



Do not allow weak passwords

 � Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.

 � Require password changes every 90 days.

 � Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

Monitor and stay current

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

 � Test and educate employees regarding information security.

 � Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. Regularly 

take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their security, and remediate 

any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor the news for any new vulnerabil-

ities: this gives a head start in identifying affected resources and applying necessary 

patches.

 � Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an ex-

ternal attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote management of servers 

and network equipment. 

 � Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking internal 

infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.

 � Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code analysis, to 

identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at risk 

of attack.

 � Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources. Configure 

servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such as TCP/UDP 

flooding or high numbers of database requests).

Keep clients in mind

 � Improve security awareness among clients.

 � Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common attacks.

 � Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not give out 

such information by email or over the phone.

 � Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.

 � Inform of security-related events.

21



How vendors can secure their products

 � Follow all of the recommendations given in the section on corporate security.

 � Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).

 � Regularly audit the security of software and web applications,  

including source-code analysis.

 � Keep web servers and database software up to date. 

 � Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

How users can avoid falling victim

Invest in security:

 � Use only licensed software. 

 � Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.

 � Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches. 

Protect your data:

 � Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a copy 

on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.

 � Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.

 � Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.

Do not use weak passwords:

 � Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, num-

bers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to create and 

securely store passwords.

 � Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that you use.

 � Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every two to 

three months.

Be vigilant:

 � Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.

 � Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that information 

entered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.

 � Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.

 � Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.

 � Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or product 

being advertised.

 � Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the 

most important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn 

from our own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data 

from authoritative sources. 

Any particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware, 

is considered in this report as a single unique information security threat. 

Each event is characterized by the following parameters:

 � Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. In 

cases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly 

from an individual, client, or employee, the attack target is "Humans" On 

the other hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place 

malware on corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individ-

ual, the attack target is "Computers, servers, and network equipment."

 � Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results 

in theft of payment card information, the motive is "data theft."

 � Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An at-

tacker can perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services 

available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to re-

sources or information. For the purposes of this report, this process is 

referred to as "hacking." Credential compromise and web attacks are 

put in separate categories for greater granularity.

 � Victim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked 

companies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For 

example, the "Hospitality and entertainment" category includes com-

panies providing paid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and 

restaurants. The "Online services" category includes platforms where 

users can fulfill their needs online, for example ticket and hotel aggrega-

tor websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social me-

dia resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale 

cyberattacks affecting more than one industry (most often, malware 

outbreaks) have been placed in the "Multiple industries" category.

We believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because 

of reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in 

incident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the pre-

cise number of threats. This research is conducted in order to draw the 

attention of companies and ordinary individuals who care about the state 

of information security to the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as 

well as to highlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.
