Last week, an unidentified malware (with SHA-256�
171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b) was discovered and�
circulated on Twitter by researcher @JAMES_MHT. Many researchers - including us - were unable to
identify the malware so we decided to dig a bit further.

In this post, we will share our findings about this malware: its targets, technical analysis, the related�
attacks and the threat actor behind it.

Targets

One of the first things we wanted to know is if this malware has a specific target–thanks to researcher��
@benkow_ some open directories on the malware C&C were discovered. One of the open directories
contained logs of victim IPs and computer names:

While there are not that many IP victims logged on this particular C&C, a look-up on ipintel.io showed
a concentration of victims from Germany and Austria:

Incidentally, a quick dump of the malware code reveals the string “my_de” and “my_botnet” where the
“de” in the first string may refer to Germany’s country code:�

Due to this and the results of our analysis below, we tagged this malware DELoader (detected as
W32/DELoader.A!tr).

DELoader
Analysis

In a nutshell, DELoader’s primary purpose is to load additional malware on the system. It does this by
initially creating a suspended explorer.exe process:

It then proceeds to decrypt an embedded DLL from its body and inject it into explorer.exe:



The injected DLL then attempts to download a file from the link�
hxxp://remembermetoday4.asia/00/b.bin:



Upon the time of analysis, the malware C&C was already sinkholed. Code-wise, the malware expects
to download a portable executable (PE) file as it validates the MZ header of the downloaded file. If��
valid, this PE file is then copied to a newly allocated memory:�

It then searches for instance of a running explorer.exe process where it then injects the downloaded
file using �CreateRemoteThread API:



DELoader’s routine doesn’t tell much about its intentions since its payload simply installs an additional
PE file. This PE file could be any malware, or simply an updated copy of itself.��

Either way, it leads us to the next question – what is the motive behind DELoader?

Related
Attacks

The registrant information of the malware C&C, resdomactivationa.asia, leads us to the next clue:

The registrant details list someone named Aleksandr
Sirofimov� from Russia. Of course, we certainly
don’t know if Aleksandr is a real person, a stolen identity, an alias for a group, or the ‘nom de guerre’
of an individual cybercriminal. However, the important thing is that these same registrant details have



been frequently used in the past to register malicious domains.

Below is an overview of some of the related attacks we were able to correlate using the email
address sir777alex@outlook.com:

From the above graph we can extract the infection chain for DELoader, which is delivered through
malicious JavaScript downloaders:

Since the JavaScript downloaders come from ZIP files with “invoice” themes, it is more or less sent to�



victims as an attachment to malicious emails.

Furthermore, the above correlation enabled us to identify that the actor (or actors), using the name
“Aleksandr,” registered malicious domains as early as the 3  quarter of 2015, while DELoader first�
surfaced by at least February of 2016.

One of the malicious tools “Aleksandr” used is a Zeus
variation – an infamous banking Trojan whose
source code was leaked five years ago. Here is a graph of some of the related Zeus variants out of the�
many Zeus C&C domains “Aleksandr” registered:

An online search of the domain goodvin77787.in
leads us to this blog. The blog talks about a DHL-
themed Zeus campaign targeting German-speaking
users where all the related Zeus C&Cs were
registered using “Aleksandr’s” details.

So we now know that person or persons behind “Aleksandr” have been (or are still) involved in a
malicious campaign for stealing banking credentials. True to the nature of DELoader, the previous
campaign also targeted German-speaking users.

Are
German-Speaking
Users
"Aleksandr’s"
Only
Target?

Another domain the individual or group known as “Aleksandr” registered is bestbrowser-2015.biz.
This domain was used as a C&C server for Android
Marcher variants – an Android banking Trojan
sold on Russian underground forums:

https://rebsnippets.blogspot.com.br/2015/11/dhl-themed-zeus-campaign-is-using.html


Interestingly, these trojans were configured to steal credentials from �Australian banks. Below is a code
snippet from one of the Android Marcher samples:

It is worth noting that these Marcher variants surfaced around the same time “Aleksandr” was running
Zeus campaigns in the 3  and 4  quarter of 2015. This suggests that he was running his malicious
regional campaigns simultaneously.

Conclusion

While DELoader is a relatively new malware, the findings in this research demonstrate that the threat�
actor behind it has actually been around for quite some time, and has left a substantial amount of
fingerprints over the Internet.�

Historical information shows that the individual or group using the name “Aleksandr” have been
involved in bank information theft not only of German-speaking users, but have also targeted
Australian users. It is possible that DELoader may be used to aid in similar purposes in the future.

We are unable to confirm the legitimacy of “Aleksandr’s” registrant details, or if he (or they) is working�
with a group. We may, however, have an idea on where “Aleksandr” is located.

rd th



Earlier, we showed that the geolocations of DELoader victims were concentrated in Germany and
Austria. You might have also noticed that one of the IPs deviated from that area – it resolved
to Kiev,Ukraine:

This is odd since German is not a common language in Ukraine. So we theorized that this anomalous
event may be due to someone testing the DELoader.

To test our theory, we looked up the IP in the C&C logs to find more information. Can you find the��
interesting string in the IP’s computer name below?

High five if you found “ALEXANDR”.�
