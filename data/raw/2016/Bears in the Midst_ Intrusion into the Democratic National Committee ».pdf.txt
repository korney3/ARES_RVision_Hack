Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into

the Democratic National Committee

June 15, 2016 UPDATE:
CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two

separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the

DNC network in May 2016. On June 15, 2016 a blog post to a WordPress

site authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0

claiming credit for breaching the Democratic National Committee.

This blog post presents documents alleged to have originated from

the DNC.

Whether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence

disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’

authenticity and origin. Regardless, these claims do nothing to

lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s

involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public

and the greater security community.

 

There is rarely a dull day at CrowdStrike where we are not detecting or

responding to a breach at a company somewhere around the globe. In

all of these cases, we operate under strict confidentiality rules with

our customers and cannot reveal publicly any information about

these attacks. But on rare occasions, a customer decides to go public

with information about their incident and give us permission to

share our knowledge of the adversary tradecraft with the broader

community and help protect even those who do not happen to be our

customers. This story is about one of those cases.

CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by

the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing

body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach.

We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified

two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and

FANCY BEAR. We’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors

attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well.

In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of

all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist

groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is superb,

operational security second to none and the extensive usage of

‘living-off-the-land’ techniques enables them to easily bypass many

security solutions they encounter. In particular, we identified

advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities

including deliberate targeting and ‘access management’ tradecraft –

both groups were constantly going back into the environment to

change out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new

Command & Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay

ahead of being detected. Both adversaries engage in extensive

political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government

of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the

Russian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence

services.

COZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports as CozyDuke or

APT 29) is the adversary group that last year successfully infiltrated

the unclassified networks of the White House, State Department, and

US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to the US government, they have

targeted organizations across the Defense, Energy, Extractive,

Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing Media, Think Tanks,

Pharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries, along with

Universities. Victims have also been observed in Western Europe,

Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and

Central Asian countries. COZY BEAR’s preferred intrusion method is a

broadly targeted spearphish campaign that typically includes web

links to a malicious dropper. Once executed on the machine, the code

will deliver one of a number of sophisticated Remote Access Tools

(RATs), including AdobeARM, ATI-Agent, and MiniDionis. On many

occasions, both the dropper and the payload will contain a range of

techniques to ensure the sample is not being analyzed on a virtual

machine, using a debugger, or located within a sandbox. They have

extensive checks for the various security software that is installed on

the system and their specific configurations. When specific versions

are discovered that may cause issues for the RAT, it promptly exits.

These actions demonstrate a well-resourced adversary with a

thorough implant-testing regime that is highly attuned to slight

configuration issues that may result in their detection, and which

would cause them to deploy a different tool instead. The implants are

highly configurable via encrypted configuration files, which allow the

adversary to customize various components, including C2 servers,

the list of initial tasks to carry out, persistence mechanisms,

encryption keys and others. An HTTP protocol with encrypted payload

is used for the Command & Control communication.

FANCY BEAR (also known as Sofacy or APT 28) is a separate Russian-

based threat actor, which has been active since mid 2000s, and has

been responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the

Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors. Their

victims have been identified in the United States, Western Europe,

Brazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea.

Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims

has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic

interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation

with Главное Разведывательное
Управление (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU,
Russia’s premier military intelligence service. This adversary has a

wide range of implants at their disposal, which have been developed

over the course of many years and include Sofacy, X-Agent, X-Tunnel,

WinIDS, Foozer and DownRange droppers, and even malware for

Linux, OSX, IOS, Android and Windows Phones. This group is known

for its technique of registering domains that closely resemble

domains of legitimate organizations they plan to target. Afterwards,

they establish phishing sites on these domains that spoof the look

and feel of the victim’s web-based email services in order to steal

their credentials. FANCY BEAR has also been linked publicly to

intrusions into the German Bundestag and France’s TV5 Monde TV

station in April 2015.

At DNC, COZY BEAR intrusion has been identified going back to

summer of 2015, while FANCY BEAR separately breached the network

in April 2016. We have identified no collaboration between the two

actors, or even an awareness of one by the other. Instead, we

observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same

systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials.

While you would virtually never see Western intelligence agencies

going after the same target without de-confliction for fear of

compromising each other’s operations, in Russia this is not an

uncommon scenario. “Putin’s Hydra: Inside Russia’s Intelligence
Services”, a recent paper from European Council on Foreign
Relations, does an excellent job outlining the highly adversarial

relationship between Russia’s main intelligence services –

Федеральная Служба Безопасности
(FSB), the primary domestic intelligence agency but one with also

significant external collection and ‘active measures’ remit,

Служба Внешней Разведки (SVR), the primary
foreign intelligence agency, and the aforementioned GRU. Not only do

they have overlapping areas of responsibility, but also rarely share

intelligence and even occasionally steal sources from each other and

compromise operations. Thus, it is not surprising to see them engage

in intrusions against the same victim, even when it may be a waste

of resources and lead to the discovery and potential compromise of

mutual operations.

The COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant

developed in Python and compiled with py2exe and another

Powershell backdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows

Management Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the

adversary to launch malicious code automatically after a specified

period of system uptime or on a specific schedule. The Powershell

backdoor is ingenious in its simplicity and power. It consists of a

single obfuscated command setup to run persistently, such as:

This one-line powershell command, stored only in WMI database,

establishes an encrypted connection to C2 and downloads additional

powershell modules from it, executing them in memory. In theory, the

additional modules can do virtually anything on the victim system.

The encryption keys in the script were different on every system.

Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by

the actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement

purposes.

FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent

malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file

transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32

commands such as:

rundll32.exe “C:\Windows\twain_64.dll”

In addition, FANCY BEAR’s X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which

facilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also

execute remote commands. Both tools were deployed via RemCOM,

an open-source replacement for PsExec available from GitHub. They

also engaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such

as periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System and

wevtutil cl Security commands) and resetting timestamps of

files.

Intelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US

political targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements

directed upon those actors. Regardless of the agency or unit tasked

with this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated

candidates and parties are of critical interest to both hostile and

friendly nation states. The 2016 presidential election has the world’s

attention, and leaders of other states are anxiously watching and

planning for possible outcomes. Attacks against electoral candidates

and the parties they represent are likely to continue up until the

election in November.
