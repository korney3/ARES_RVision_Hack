FILED IN: Cybersecurity, Threat Prevention, Unit 42 
TAGGED: APAC, Elirks, Japan, PlugX, Scarlet Mimic

A recent, well-publicized attack on a Japanese business involved two malware families, PlugX

and Elirks, that were found during the investigation. PlugX has been used in a number of attacks

since first being discovered in 2012, and we have published several articles related to its use,

including an analysis of an attack campaign targeting Japanese companies.

Elirks, less widely known than PlugX, is a basic backdoor Trojan, first discovered in 2010, that is

primarily used to steal information from compromised systems. We mostly observe attacks using

Elirks occurring in East Asia. One of the unique features of the malware is that it retrieves its C2

address by accessing a pre-determined microblog service or SNS. Attackers create accounts on

those services and post encoded IP addresses or the domain names of real C2 servers in

advance of distributing the backdoor. We have seen multiple Elirks variants using Japanese blog

services for the last couple of years. Figure 1 shows embedded URL in an Elirks sample found

in early 2016.

In another sample found in 2014, an attacker used a Japanese blog service. The relevant

account still exists at the time of writing this article (Figure 2).

Unit 42 previously identified an Elirks variant during our analysis of the attack campaign called

Scarlet Mimic. It is years-long campaign targeting minority rights activists and governments. The

malware primarily used in this series of attacks was FakeM. Our researchers described the

threat sharing infrastructure with Elirks in the report.

As of this writing, we can note similarities between previously seen Elirks attacks and this recent

case in Japan.

Spear Phishing Email with PDF attachment

Figure 3 shows an email which was sent to a ministry of Taiwan in May 2012.

Figure 3 Spear Phishing Email sent to a ministry of Taiwan

The email characteristics were bit similar to the recent case (Table 1).

2012 2016

Email Sender Masquerades as an existing

bank in Taiwan

Masquerade as an existing aviation

company in Japan

Email Recipient Representative email address

of a ministry of Taiwan, which

is publicly available.

Representative email address of a

subsidiary company, which is

publicly available.

Subject “Bank credit card statement”

in Chinese

“Airline E-Ticket” in Japanese

Attachment PDF file named “Electronic

Billing

1015” in Chinese

File named “E-TKT” in Japanese

with PDF icon

Table 1 Email characteristics

When a user opened the attached PDF file, the following message is displayed. It exploits a

vulnerability in Adobe Flash, CVE-2011-0611 embedded in the PDF and installs Elirks malware

on the system.

Figure 4 opening malicious PDF attachment

Airline E-Ticket

Attackers choose a suitable file name to lure targeted individual or organization. In the recent

case, the malicious attachment name in the email was reported as “E-TKT”. We found similar

file name in the previous attack in Taiwan in August 2012 (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Elirks executable file masquerade as folder of E-Ticket

When opening the file, Elirks executes itself on the computer and creates ticket.doc to deceive



users (Figure 6).

Figure 6 doc file created by Elirks

We’ve also seen another file name related to aviation at Taiwan in March 2012. Figure 7 shows

PDF file named “Airline Reservation Numbers (updated version).pdf”. When opening the PDF

file, it displays the exactly same message with the Figure4, exploits CVE-2011-0611 and installs

Elirks.

Figure 7 PDF named “Airline Reservation Number”

Currently, we have found no reliable evidence to indicate the same adversary attacked a

company in Japan in 2016 and multiple organizations in Taiwan in 2012. However, we can see

some resemblances between the two attacks. In both cases, attackers used the same malware

family, crafted spear phishing emails in a similar manner, and seem to be interested in some

areas related to aviation. We have been seeing multiple Elirks variants targeting Japan in the

last few years, potentially indicating an ongoing cyber espionage campaign. We will keep an

eye on the threat actors.
