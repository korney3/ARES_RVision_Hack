Exploring CVE-2015-2545 and its users
06 May 2016

By Pierre Montagnier and Tom Lancaster

Executive Summary

This report, available at TLP:GREEN to researchers and network defenders, gives an overview of different attacks
using CVE-2015-2545. Specifically we look at the different ways attackers are triggering the vulnerability, and the
possibility that the exploit is shared amongst various groups. Based on overlaps in the samples analysed, our findings
show that there are several clusters of documents, with the majority of the document-based builders sharing similar
constructs in terms of how the final payload is discovered and executed. We also found that more recently some
attackers are triggering the vulnerability through the use of MHTML files with .doc extensions.

Background

Back in November 2015, FireEye published a report titled ‘Two For One’ [1] detailing two new zero days, one affecting
Microsoft (MS) Word and the other affecting the Windows operating system. Our report focuses on the former, CVE
2015-2545.

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the processing of Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files and allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary code. We have been tracking samples exploiting this vulnerability as well as tracking the associated
malware, much of which has been already discussed in public reporting.

The report summarises our findings based on samples collected in 2016, and explores similarities and differences in
the shellcode between different documents exploiting this vulnerability.
