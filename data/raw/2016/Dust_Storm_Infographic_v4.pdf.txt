Watering hole attack on a popular 
software reseller delivers an 
Internet Explorer zero-day to a 
number of unsuspecting targets. 
The group begins locating and 
securing alternative means of 
persistence on victim systems.

A second-stage 
implant delivered by a 

variant of the S-Type 
backdoor shortly 

following its initial 
reconnaissance compromises 

the investment arm of a 
major Japanese Automaker 

just two weeks before 11 
auto worker unions demand a 

monthly raise of 6,000 yen.

Attack group 
adopts and customizes 

several Android backdoors 
to suit their purposes and uses 
a massive infrastructure 
compared to previous attacks. 
Initial backdoors are relatively 
simple, but continually forward 
all SMS messages and call 
information back to their C2 
servers. All identified victims 
reside in Japan or South Korea.

A number of second-stage 
backdoors with hardcoded 
proxy addresses and 
credentials compromise
a number of Japanese 
companies involved in 
power generation, oil
and natural gas, 
construction, finance, 
and transportation. 

Two new waves of attacks 
are launched, targeting 
multiple Japanese 
companies including a 
Japanese subsidiary of
a South Korean electric 
utility and a major 
Japanese oil and gas 
company. The most likely 
goals are reconnaissance 
and long-term espionage.

SPEAR believes that 
attacks of this nature 

into companies 
involved in Japanese 

critical infrastructure 
and resources are 

ongoing and likely to 
continue to escalate 

in the future.

October 2011

Attack group attempts to 
take advantage of the 
ongoing Libyan crisis by 
phishing the news cycle 
regarding Muammar 
Gaddafi’s death, targeting 
US defense targets.

Attack campaign 
leverages previously 
used flash exploit and 
Internet Explorer 
zero-day.

July to August 2011

Attack group 
attempts to gather 
user credentials for 
Yahoo, Windows Live, 
and other accounts 
through several different 
phishing domains.

2011

Attacks leverage an 
unpatched Internet 
Explorer 8 vulnerability 
to gain a foothold into 
victim networks and 
start to garner
 some notoriety.

Early operations are 
extremely blunt, relatively 
unsophisticated, and 
readily picked up by the 
security industry.

Attack activity greatly 
subsides, although several 

new domains that will be 
used later are registered.
