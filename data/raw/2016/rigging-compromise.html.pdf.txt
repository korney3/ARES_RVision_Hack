This post was authored by Nick Biasini with contributions by Joel Esler.

Exploit Kits are one of the biggest threats that affects users, both inside and outside the
enterprise, as it indiscriminately compromises simply by visiting a web site, delivering a
malicious payload. One of the challenges with exploit kits is at any given time there are
numerous kits active on the Internet. RIG is one of these exploit kits that is always around
delivering malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. RIG first appeared in our telemetry�
back in November of 2013, back then we referred to it as Goon, today it's known as RIG.

We started focusing on RIG and found some interesting data similar to what we found
while analyzing Angler. This post will discuss RIG, findings in the data, and what actions�
were taken as a result.

RIG compromises users like any exploit kit. It starts with a user being redirected to a
landing page. This is done via malicious iframes or malvertising and looks similar the
following:

It begins with an initial link to a javascript:

Then when the browser is redirected it receives the following:

This page is just a simple iframe that retrieves the actual landing page. The request for the
landing page looks like:

When the user is actually delivered a landing page, it is highly obfuscated and lacks some
of the English based text we see in other exploit kits. Below is a small sample of the
obfuscated landing page:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KWk9_CBKvog/Vo6auuoOCgI/AAAAAAAAAT4/SvNMtgKodNI/s1600/03-page.png


After probing the browser RIG delivers an exploit to the end user. Below is an example of
flash exploit that RIG was delivering:�

One interesting aspect of RIG is the actual payload is obtained in a separate GET request.
We usually see the exploit and payload delivered together or at least delivered in a highly
obfuscated manner, not a GET request delivering an actual executable. This is not the
case for RIG. Below is a sample of the GET request for the malicious payload:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ulT-hWFeNNs/Vo6bG0KFg8I/AAAAAAAAAUA/CPWebHO430g/s1600/04-page.png
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i53j37Gs91k/Vo6btcchSjI/AAAAAAAAAUI/y2_XSGniqCY/s1600/05-delivery.png
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJn-GoKDmgY/Vo6b4skex2I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/mjuDgTUiu74/s1600/06-payload.png


A final interesting aspect to RIG is the naming convention for the payloads on the end�
system. RIG tries to hide as legitimate services on Windows platforms.  Common
examples included defsrag.exe, dissdkchk.exe, systemrestore.exe. These are designed to
look similar to defrag, diskchk, and the system restore functionality in Windows. However,
in all cases these files were dropped in to TEMP folders instead of SYSTEM32 where they�
would be expected to be located. 

RIG exploit kit is steadily compromising users, below is a sample of the data we gathered
over two months related to systems serving RIG exploit kit. Users were being driven to
RIG through malicious iframes and malvertising. The overall volume of activity was lower,
affecting hundreds of users, instead of the thousands we saw impacted by Angler.

An analysis of the data associated with RIG revealed some familiar patterns. First was the
use of domain shadowing. We found that domain shadowing is currently being used
exclusively to host RIG, unlike with Angler, we were unable to find other domain activity�
during the two month period. This particular use of domain shadowing has interesting
aspects related to the subdomains themselves. RIG is using very short string based
subdomains ranging from english based words like admin, user, news, and server. Also
present was short random strings like qwe21, qwe23, htr43, and htr43. Leveraging the IP
addresses found we were able to identify in excess of 7000 subdomains being used by

addresses found we were able to identify in excess of 7000 subdomains being used by
RIG over several months. The activity was spread evenly among those subdomains with
few having more than 10 hits in the months of activity and the majority having less than
five.�

RIG, like most exploit kits, is getting users infected via the use of malicious iframes
injected in websites and malvertising. There were a couple of interesting things that we
observed in the data. First is the use of Google and Bing in the redirection chain. We have
seen this before in Nuclear exploit kit and this will provide an extra layer in the chain to
help ensure users are getting to the landing pages. The second interesting fact dealt with
the volume, there were more than 60 unique referers observed over the two month period
but the average volume was low with most having less than five entries.�

During the two month period shown here we saw RIG using Flash to compromise
systems. The primary exploit being used was CVE-2015-5119. We saw a total of 30
unique hashes being used to compromise systems during the two month period. 70% of
those hashes were known by VirusTotal and had some protection from an AV perspective.
Despite that users were still being compromised and malicious payloads were being
delivered.

The most common exploit kit payload today is overwhelmingly ransomware, RIG however,

The most common exploit kit payload today is overwhelmingly ransomware, RIG however,
was decidedly different it was exclusively delivering spambot variants. The most common
payload were variants of Tofsee which is a spam botnet. The way these payloads work is
by sending large amounts of spam email related to various topics. Spambot payloads
were very common to exploit kits several years ago, but most have moved on to payloads
that guarantee quick monetization. The use of these payloads by RIG is an interesting
differentiator from other exploit kits Talos has been observing.

Most of the payloads we found had very good detection on VirusTotal with most being
detected by more than half of the AV vendors. Again, despite this RIG continues to
successfully compromise users that are primarily using versions of Internet Explorer on
Windows platforms, based on the user agent information.

IP Infrastructure

This is the most interesting aspect of our RIG research. We observed 44 different IP
addresses delivering some form of RIG. As shown above you can see that on most days
there were only one or two IP's actively hosting RIG. 

When we resolved the IP's to the associated ASN we found something surprising. With the
exception of a single IP address all IP's belonged to the same ASN (35415).

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RKU1vYovhz8/Vo6cr6uFQbI/AAAAAAAAAUo/ZakrrgWY5Nw/s1600/09-ip-inf.png


This particular ASN is associated with Webzilla, a provider out of Russia. Further
investigation actually revealed that all of the addresses were leased to Eurobyte, which is
another Russian provider. Talos reached out to both providers giving them the information
regarding the hosts that we observed serving RIG. Webzilla responded and identified the�
customers that were generating the events and blocked the hosts successfully. Below is a
graph showing the RIG activity we observed during our investigation:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCppf68xuwQ/Vo6c1RD7dwI/AAAAAAAAAUw/gZm1r_LIabU/s1600/10-asn.png


Monitoring the amount of RIG activity after our notification, we have consistently seen new�
servers that are being hosted by Eurobyte being stood up and compromising users via
RIG. We again reached out to Eurobyte to try and get a response directly from the
provider where the malicious activity is being hosted. Despite multiple emails to Eurobyte
RIG activity continued as new addresses get stood up after being reported to WebZilla.
This underscores one of the major problems we face today, leaf providers. As providers
could have multiple downstream leaf providers we find that we routinely have success in�
dealing with larger providers. These providers help get systems shut down, but without the
cooperation of the smaller downstream providers the adversaries just stand up new
servers and move on. We were able to inflict some damage to RIG during our�
investigation, but were unable to actually get the actors behind the activity stopped.

Since Eurobyte chose not to acknowledge or respond to our repeated messages we did a
little further research on the activity associated with the provider. We worked with our
research partners at OpenDNS Labs to get better visibility into the domains that were
hosted. Based on our research we found a total of seven class C networks owned by the
provider, with one of the class C's serving as their corporate network. Based on the
information from OpenDNS provided we found approximately 25,000 domains being
hosted on this address space. These domains were heavily leveraging the Russian TLD
(.ru), as expected. Three of the class C networks were seen serving RIG during the
period. We took the domains that OpenDNS provided and queried them against Talos’s
automated web reputation. We found that of the six class C address spaces that are being
used by Eurobyte five were scored significantly negatively in web reputation. The only��
exception was one Class C network that was hosting the Russian payment platform e-
autopay<dot>com.

Based on all this information and Eurobytes failure to respond or even acknowledge abuse
requests Talos and OpenDNS have decided to blacklist the five suspect subnets for a�
period of 30 days. After this time Talos and OpenDNS will re-evaluate the provider to
determine if an extended blacklisting should occur. This activity will add all the IP's in the

determine if an extended blacklisting should occur. This activity will add all the IP's in the
address spaces to Cisco's IP and Domain intelligence blacklists. These blacklists are
leveraged by multiple Cisco security products and will effectively protect our customers
from any activity from this provider. This includes all technologies that consume our
reputation services.  The advantage of these blacklists, as well as our Advanced Malware
Protection with our fantastic AMP line of products is, this detection adapts and changes in
real time to the threat.

Additionally, after reviewing the data provided by OpenDNS we worked with them to make
sure that the threat was mitigated from their perspective as well. We found that the
majority of the address space was already being blocked by OpenDNS, but we were able
to round out the protection and make sure that Eurobyte won't be serving malicious
content to both Cisco and OpenDNS customers. For additional information on how
OpenDNS has been tracking RIG please see the following blog    from the most recent talk
at Brucon. 

Talos’s unparalleled visibility into threat data allows us to automatically adjust protection

The exploit kit problem is larger than just Angler. However, the news related to exploit kits
has been largely focused on Angler in 2015, now Angler seems to be on a temporary
vacation since the end of 2015. This is expected with the sophistication, scope, and
innovation that Angler incorporates. However, as evidenced by this research, it doesn't
take innovation and sophistication to compromise users. RIG exploit kit is steadily and
consistently compromising users and delivering malicious payloads. Visibility into the other
exploit kits is valuable and necessary to help shed light on the behavior and identify the
providers they are leveraging to help protect and educate the community.

Additionally, this research shed light on the problem of leaf providers. Providers are in a
tough spot with lots of systems and limited resources. That was one of the driving force
behind Project Aspis, to help aid providers by providing resources to help them identify
and mitigate these threats. It's understandable that malicious activity is going to occur at
hosting providers. It's impossible for them to know the intentions of a customer when they
are purchasing systems. At the same time when a provider is notified of malicious activity�
it is their responsibility to at least acknowledge the abuse and work to validate and, if
legitimate, take the system offline. Webzilla did just that in our experience, but Eurobyte�
has not. This lack of response lead Talos to make the decision to blacklist large portions of
the provider's network to ensure that our customers are protected since reporting the
abuse alone is not enough.

Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is
ideally suited to prevent the execution
of the malware used by these threat
actors.

CWS or WSA web scanning prevents
access to malicious websites and
detects malware used in these attacks.

The Network Security protection of IPS
and NGFW have up-to-date signatures

to detect malicious network activity by threat actors.

As it happens, I'm just running an analysis on sites hosted by Eurobyte LLC either
currently on in the past, using a somewhat different data set. So far, out of 7500
sites analysed, 35% are tagged by Google as being malicious. This probably
means that many of the other 65% are also bad, but they just haven't been tagged.

The Eurobyte LLC range is actually a bit bigger than you specify, they rent the
entire 46.30.40.0/21 range from Webzilla. The /24s you are missing are:

46.30.40.0/24
46.30.41.0/24
46.30.47.0/24

Webzilla also provide services for the fairly notorious McHost.ru in the
178.208.64.0/19 range.

Thanks for the info Conrad. We chose not to block several of the ranges
since they were either hosting legitimate activity or were the corporate
address space for Eurobyte.
