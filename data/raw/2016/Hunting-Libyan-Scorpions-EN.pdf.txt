3 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Using malwares as weapon in an active warzone such as Libya, make 

the victims easy targets for assassination or kidnapping by tracking 

their physical locations and monitoring them day and night. 

Executive Summary 

Libya maybe known in non-stable political system, civil war and militant groups fighting for the land and oil 

control but it is definitely not known in cyber malicious activities, cyber espionage and hacking groups. No 

parties in Libya before this analysis reported to use cyber attacks, malwares nor recruit hackers to spy on their 

rivals. Today we have a different story. 

In the past weeks on 6 August 2016, Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) received a numerous 

Android malwares operating in different areas in Libya especially in Tripoli and Benghazi. 

The malware spreads very fast using Telegram messenger application in smartphones, targeting high-profile 

Libyan influential and political figures. 

The malware first discovery was after a highly Libyan influential Telegram account compromised via web 

Telegram using IP address from Spain. 

The following day, the attackers spread an Android malware binded with legitimate Android application from 

the compromised Telegram account to all his contacts pretending it is an important voice message (misspelled 

it by “Voice Massege.apk”) which indicates a non-english (maybe an Arabic) attacker. 

After spreading the malware, more Android smartphones has been infected using the same technique (via 

Telegram) and then repost the malware again and again making a network of victims. 

Analysis of this incident led us to believe that this operation and the group behind it which we call Libyan 

Scorpions is a malware operation in use since September 2015 and operated by a politically motivated group 

whose main objective is intelligence gathering, spying on influentials and political figures and operate an 

espionage campaign within Libya. 

Also, the analysis of the incident led to the discovery of multiple malwares targeting Android and Windows 

machines. 

Libyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to 

have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not 

particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don’t need to be sophisticated in order 

to be effective.

4 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) 

Libyan Scorpions is believed to be a political motivated group targeting a high-level influential and political 

figures in multiple cities within Libya.  

 

Libyan Scorpions first compromised a personal Telegram account for a Libyan influential person with 

unknown vector. The victim received a push notification from his Telegram app that someone from Spain is 

logged into his account: 

 

 

The victim mistakenly deleted Telegram application from his phone thinking that this is going to stop the 

attacker(s). 

Second day, the attacker used the victim phone number to spear phish his contacts in Telegram by pretending 

that the real person is sending a voice message while the file is actually a malicious APK (Android Package) file. 

 

This APK file targets only Android-based smartphones. Once the new victim click on the APK file, the 

application installs itself in the device without any problem and is fully functional. The icon of the application 

appears in the Apps menu named (URL Shortener).

Malware Analysis 

Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) started analyzing the APK file (malware) and the first step 

was to unpack it. 

 

After unpacking with apktool and reading (AndroidManifest.xml) file, it appears that the application is a 

malware injected inside a legitimate application having java package name: 

de.keineantwort.android.urlshortener.

Searching for the application in Google Play store with that specific package name 

(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.keineantwort.android.urlshortener) yields:

8 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

The application exists in the store and the Libyan Scorpions hacking group took an instance of the APK and 

injected their malware into that legitimate application to spread it. 

The real application is created by keineantwort.de and we have verified it from their main website: 

 

Going back to (AndroidManifest.xml) file, the malware register itself as receiver of almost all intents and 

request almost all permissions available in Android system!

The malware can access location, network state, battery status, Bluetooth, camera, capturing audio, 

internet, …, etc. 

After launching the malicious application for the first time, it checks if the Android device is rooted or not 

and if rooted, it asks for root permission.

11 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Carrying on the reverse engineering of the malware, we found a file called “config.json” which is a base64 

encoded json file containing the configuration of the malware and its Command and Control (C2). The 

characteristics of the malware (“a.txt” and “config.json” files) and the functionality of it is very similar to 

JSocket and AlienSpy famous Android Remote Access Tools (RATs). 

 

Decoding the “config.json” file using base64 decoder shows that the C2 hostname/domain is: 

winmeif.myq-see.com using the port 64631 

Resolving the hostname gives: 41.208.110.46 which is a static Libyan IP address owned by Libya Telecom 

and Technology Backbone.

The picture below showing that the malware is capable of taking pictures from the camera of the 

compromised device and upload it to the C2. 

 

The malware begins by implementing a Trust Manager that accepts all certificates so that Libyan Scorpions 

hackers are sure no victim left disconnected due to SSL certificates issues.

The malware is able to turn the Android phone into a remote listening bug by opening the Microphone and 

recording the audio then send it to the C2. 

 

The malware is able to browse the files and folders stored inside the Android device.

The malware uses Allatori Java Obfuscator to protect the code and make it harder to reverse engineer and it 

obviously uses communication protocol based on Java JSON objects encapsulated in SSL connection wrapper. 

Again, this behavior and characteristics of the malware is very similar to JSocket and AlienSpy Android RATs. 

 

After finalizing the analysis of the Android malware, Cyberkov uploaded it to VirusTotal to see if it has been 

uploaded before and what information we can get from it:

20 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Cyberkov discovered that the malware has not been uploaded to VirusTotal before and the first sample of 

this malware has been uploaded by us. However, 8 out of 54 AntiVirus engines detect it which is a very low 

detection rate (15%). Most and major American top Gartner Antivirus companies did not detect it!!

Command and Control Communication 

Cyberkov tried to discover the attacker behind this malicious application by sinkholing the malware and 

analyzing the real C2. 

Sinkhole 
Cyberkov created a fake server simulating the real C2 of the Libyan Scorpions hacking group and sinkholed 

the malware to study the behavior of the malware deeply. 

Upon connection to the C2, the malware sends a lot of information about the target including: Country, 

Malware Path, Local IP Address, RAM, Android Version, Device Name, …, etc. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com     22 

 

22 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

The fake C2 server is able to send fake commands to the malware and read the reply as well. 

 

Those commands (103, 104 and 105) correspond to the following list of commands defined in the malware:

23 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Each number corresponds to one command to be done by the malware. For example, the command (111) 

uninstalls the real application “URLShortener”: 

 

Will result in:

24 Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Real C2 
By connecting to the real C2 IP address, Cyberkov found that the malware is really of JSocket/AlienSpy family 

of RATs since that family of RATs open the port 1234 with a self-signed certificate of “assylias”2. 

 

According to Shodan, the port (1234) has been spotted open since 12-07-2016 which is 25 days before the 

first discovery.

Threat Actor and Attribution 

Seems like the Libyan Scorpions threat actors are running multiple Android RATs since numerous ports 

protected by SSL layer are open in (winmeif.myq-see.com) machine. 

 

Also, the Libyan Scorpions threat actors left phpinfo.php script on the webserver running on port 80 with 

useful information that could expose them. Their machine is running Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1.

Threat Actors Infrastructure 

Going back to the IP address of the attackers (41.208.110.46), it is very important to discover the attackers 

infrastructure that maybe used to launch wider attacks using multiple RATs on multiple platforms. 

By using Threat Intelligence Platforms and Feeds such as PassiveTotal, Cyberkov was able to discover more 

activities and campaigns run by Libyan Scorpions. 

The following Heatmap shows that the IP address (41.208.110.46) has been used to launch attacks since 

9/9/2015 until the time of writing this report using 5 different hostnames and multiple malicious malwares. 

 

The following table summarizes the list of hostnames used by the attacker(s):

All of the hostnames point to the same C2 IP address used by the attackers (but sara2011.no-ip.biz): 

 

Also, using PassiveTotal, the C2 is connected to 2 more malwares used by the attackers having the following 

hashes (MD5): 

 1738ecf69b8303934bb10170bcef8926 

 93ebc337c5fe4794d33df155986a284d 

 

The first hash in the above picture is for the malware “Voice Massege.apk” which we have analyzed already.

The third hash (93ebc337c5fe4794d33df155986a284d) is a DroidJack, a malicious attacking platform, 

targeting android smartphones. 

 

Also, the name of activities and services contains net.droidjack.server name which makes us sure it is 

DroidJack malware.

To Be Continued… 

Cyberkov will continue investigating Libyan Scorpions hacking group operating in Libya and will update this 

report with a follow-up reports regarding any future cyber activities. 

Mitigating Libyan Scorpions Attacks on Android 

Cyberkov recommends the following points in order to protect the victims from such malwares: 

 Update your Android operating system regularly 

 Install DrWeb Security Space for Android (A leading Russian AntiVirus Company) 

 Use of DrWeb Telegram Bot (DrWebBot) to scan links and files shared on Telegram chats or groups 

 Install Zemana Mobile AntiVirus (A leading Turkish AntiMalware and AntiFraud Company) 

 Never install applications from unknown sources 

 Use Telegram with Secret Chat feature only 

 Always verify with your partners when sending and receiving files
