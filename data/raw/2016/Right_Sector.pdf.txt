From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Right Sector (Ukrainian: Правий сектор, Pravyi
Sektor) is a far-right Ukrainian nationalist political
party that originated in November 2013 as a
paramilitary confederation at the Euromaidan
protests in Kiev, where its street fighters fought�
against riot police.[7][8] The coalition became a
political party on 22 March 2014, at which time it
claimed to have perhaps 10,000 members.[9][10]

Founding groups included Trident (Tryzub), led by
Dmytro Yarosh and Andriy Tarasenko; and the
Ukrainian National Assembly–Ukrainian National
Self-Defense (UNA–UNSO), a
political/paramilitary organization.[11][12] Other
founding groups included the Social-National
Assembly and its Patriot of Ukraine paramilitary
wing, White Hammer, and Carpathian Sich. White
Hammer was expelled in March 2014,[13] and in
the following months Patriot left the organization
along with many UNA-UNSO members.[14]

In June 2014 one of the groups was assigned by
the Interior Ministry to surveil Mariupol after it
captured the city from Russian-backed
insurgents.[15][16]

Right Sector's political ideology has been
characterized as nationalist,[17][18]

ultranationalist,[19][20] neofascist,[21] right-wing,[22]

or far right.[23][24][25][26] Right Sector was the
second-most mentioned political group in Russian
media during the first half of 2014; Russian state�
TV depicted it as neo-Nazi.[27][28] The Associated
Press found no evidence that the group had
committed hate crimes.[20] In the 2014 Ukrainian
parliamentary election Yarosh as a Right Sector
candidate won a parliament seat by winning a
single-member district with 29.8% of the votes.[29]

Right Sector spokesperson Boryslav Bereza as
an independent candidate also won a seat and district with 29.4% of the votes.[6]

Since 5 April 2015 Yarosh has acted as an advisor to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,[30] and on 11
November he formally stepped down as the group's leader.[31] On 27 December he announced
that he and his team would be withdrawing from the group entirely, declaring that Right Sector
had fulfilled its purpose 'as a revolutionary structure' and was no longer needed. He stated he�
and his faction were against pseudo-revolutionary activity that threatens the state, fringe
radicalism, and were against violent revolts against the current government. In a statement

Name [ edit ]
The organization's name in Ukrainian is Правий сектор, which can be transliterated as Pravyy
sektor and translated as Right Sector. (General-audience publications often transliterate it as
Pravy Sektor or Pravyi Sektor.) The name is derived from the group's effort to protect the right
side of the Euromaidan protestors at one point during the protests.[35]

History [ edit ]

Origins [ edit ]
Right Sector formed in late November 2013 as a
confederation of streetfighting soccer fans and right-�
wing nationalist groups: Patriot of Ukraine (Andriy
Belitsky), the Social-National Assembly, Trident
(Dmytro Yarosh), UNA–UNSO (Yuriy Shukhevych),
White Hammer, and Carpathian Sich.[11][12][36][37][38]

The BBC reports that Right Sector's Kiev organization
is primarily formed by Russian-speaking soccer fans
who share nationalist views.[39][40][41]

The organization views itself within the tradition of
Ukrainian partisans, such as the Ukrainian Insurgent

Army, which fought in the Second World War against the Soviet Union and both for and against
the Axis.[39][42] Yarosh, Right Sector's leader, has trained armed nationalists in military exercises
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.[43] Co-founder Andriy Tarasenko told LIGA news agency
in January 2014 that most participants were "ordinary citizens not related to any
organizations".[11][44]

Right Sector claims to have received donations from the Ukrainian diaspora.[10]

Entry into Euromaidan [ edit ]
Right Sector became one of the main actors in the
January 2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots, a part of the
Euromaidan protests, in their later and more violent
stages.[12][45] On 19 January 2014 the organization
encouraged its members to bring bottles to the protests
in order to produce Molotov cocktails and bombs.[11]

The Yanukovich government classified it as an�
extremist movement and threatened its members with
imprisonment.[46]

Right Sector has been described as the most organized
and most effective of the Euromaidan forces when it

came to confronting police.[47] Right Sector claims that it was the main organizer of violent
resistance against armed attacks by the state at Euromaidan.[37] Yarosh stated that the group
had amassed a sizable arsenal of weapons;[8] these include guns taken from police stations in
Western Ukraine.[48]

On 4 March 2014, the organization called on readers of its Vkontakte social-media page to
"correct th[e] misunderstanding" that had been created in English and Russian Wikipedia that
Right Sector is fascist and neo-Nazi.[49]

According to political science professor Olexiy Haran, Right Sector's role in Ukrainian politics
was "extremely exaggerated" by Ukrainians associated with Yanukovich.[27]

Aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution [ edit ]
Yarosh was proposed as a deputy to the National
Security and Defense Council of Ukraine[50] but was
not appointed. He was then offered the position of
deputy head of the National Security Council but
rejected it as being beneath him.[51]

In February 2014, Yarosh and the Israeli ambassador
to Ukraine agreed to establish a "hotline" to prevent
provocations and coordinate actions when issues
arise.[52][53] The group assists in the protection of
Jewish sites in Odessa.[54]

Russia has cited attacks by Right Sector on Russian
speakers and Jews as the main reason it sent troops into Crimea.[20]

On 7 March 2014, Tarasenko told Interfax-Ukraine that the "informal movement" would be
transforming itself into a political party at a congress on 15 March.[55][need quotation to verify]

On 11 March 2014, Russian Duma opposition leader Valery Rashkin called on Russian special
services to "liquidate" Yarosh and Right Sector's leader for West Ukraine, UNA–UNSO member
Oleksandr Muzychko.[56] He said that Muzychko had fought for Chechen separatists against
Russian troops and been charged with banditry. Muzychko (who was given the nom de guerre
"Sachko Bilyi") had also become known for the farcical Right Sector video, "Sachko

guard at a Right Sector event,
Euromaidan, Kiev, 13 April 2014

Communicates with a Prosecutor", in which he yells at a local prosecutor, snatches his tie and
threatens to drag him to Independence Square with a rope.[12]

Muzychko was shot to death in Rivne, Ukraine, on 24 March 2014. A witness told a local news
service that a dozen men took Muzychko out of a cafe, handcuffed him, and beat him and two
bodyguards. Others said that they later heard two shots fired near the cafe.�[57] Ukraine's Interior
Ministry stated that he was shot after opening fire on police and Sokil special forces. He was�
captured alive and arrested but died from his wounds before paramedics arrived.[58] Police said
he was being detained on suspicion of organized crime links, hooliganism and threatening
public officials.�[59][60][61]

Right Sector representatives held Interior Minister
Arsen Avakov  accountable for his death and vowed to
avenge him.[62] On 27 March 2014, Right Sector
supporters demanded Avakov's resignation and tried to
storm the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian
parliament).[63] The next day, the European Union's
High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine
Ashton, stated, "I strongly condemn the pressure by
activists of the Right Sector who have surrounded the
building of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Such an
intimidation of the parliament is against the democratic
principles and rule of law."[64]

A few days later the group released an app that allows its members to organize tactics at
events without being identified.�[65]

On 31 March 2014, a drunken Right Sector activist started shooting near a restaurant in central
Kiev. Three people were wounded, including the deputy head of the Kiev City State
Administration.[66]

2014 pro-Russian conflict and 2014 Ukrainian election results� [ edit ]
On 24 April 2014 Right Sector announced that it was moving its headquarters from Kiev to
Dnipropetrovsk in order to monitor the situation in eastern Ukraine[67] and that it had begun to
form a special battalion 'Donbass' for its paramilitary operations in the War in Donbass.[68]

On 22 April 2014 pro-Russian insurgents in Slovyansk detained American journalist Simon
Ostrovsky for several days on suspicion of spying for the group.[69]

Right Sector was officially registered as a political party by the �Ukrainian Ministry of Justice on
22 May 2014.[70] A regional chief told the Wall Street Journal that it was less interested in
running for office than in getting politicians to keep their promises.�[71]

In the 25 May 2014 presidential race Yarosh received 127,000 votes, 0.7% of the total
cast.[72][73][74][need quotation to verify] In a mid-May 2014 poll by Sociological group "RATING" the
party itself scored 1.7%.[75]

On 13 June 2014 a prosecutor's office in Kiev was stormed by people who claimed to be Right�
Sector activists. Yarosh denied his organization's involvement and claimed that he could not
have given orders to picket "the man who helped Euromaidan".[76][need quotation to verify]

On 15 October 2014 around 125 masked men with Right Sector insignia blocked the company
Zaporizhstal; Right Sector denied involvement in this blockade and labelled it as an attempt to
discredit the organization.[77]

In the 26 October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Yarosh as a Right Sector candidate
won a parliament seat by winning single-member district number 39 located in Vasylkivka Raion
with 29.76% of the votes.[29] The party had competed in 35 districts.[78] Yarosh did not join a
faction in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament).[79] In the same election, Boryslav Bereza,

Right Sector's chief of information, also won a seat as an independent candidate by winning a
district in Kiev with 29.44% of the votes.[6] Bereza also did not join a faction. [80]

2015 clash with Ukraine's special security service [ edit ]
On July 10, 2015, Ukrainian government forces clashed with Right Sector forces in the city of
Mukacheve, located in Western Ukraine. Two people were killed. According to President
Poroshenko's parliamentary faction leader Yuriy Lutsenko, these events "result[ed from] the
conflict of interests between illegal armed groups and a mafia overtly cooperating with law��
enforcers." [81] Some local leaders indicated the conflict ensued when Right Sector forces�
attempted to clamp down on the lucrative illegal cigarette smuggling trade to Western Europe,
in which local law enforcement have been complicit. Immediate fallout from the events included
the sacking of the leadership of the local Zakarpatya district customs service. Ukrainian MP
Mykhailo Lanyo, fingered in the smuggling ring, reportedly fled Ukraine.��[82] Right Sector leader
Yarosh called for calm, and denied that Right Sector troops were being withdrawn from eastern
Ukraine.[83][84][85][86]

Contemporary situation [ edit ]
Yarosh resigned as Right Sector leader on 11 November 2015. [31] Late December 2015 he
announced that he was forming a new political party that would start in February 2016.[87]

Paramilitary operations [ edit ]
Right Sector seized military weaponry from an
Interior Ministry arsenal in western Ukraine, near
Lviv, towards the end of the Maidan revolution. Right
Sector delivered some weapons to Ukrainian
authorities in the aftermath of the revolution, and
kept others.[88]

Following the collapse of the Yanukovych
government, with police having largely abandoned
the streets of Kiev, groups of young men, including
members of Right Sector, patrolled them armed
mostly with baseball bats and sometimes with
guns.[47]

According to Yarosh, Right Sector has recruited retired officers of the interior ministry and the�
security agencies. He told Newsweek that "as in any army" it has specialists who are trained to
use S-300 antiaircraft missiles.[10]

Ukrainian Volunteer Corps [ edit ]
Right Sector has its own volunteer battalion that is fighting in the �War in Donbass.[89] It was
formed late April 2014.[68] On 19 July 2014 Right Sector said it was ready to contribute 5,000
people to fight, if the military provided suitable combat equipment.�[90]

Right Sector lost twelve fighters when ambushed outside �Donetsk in August 2014. Yarosh, the
group's leader, vowed his group would avenge the deaths.[91] On 17 August 2014 Right Sector
accused the Interior Ministry of harbouring counterrevolutionary forces seeking to destroy the
Ukrainian volunteer movement.[92] It said that Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Yevdokimov's
followers among the police had illegally searched or detained dozens of Right Sector volunteers
and confiscated weapons they had taken in combat.�[93] Interior Minister Arsen Avakov replied,
saying that he had already submitted a request to President Poroshenko that Yevdokimov be
dismissed.[94]

Fighters of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK)

March in Kiev on anniversary of the
birthday of Stepan Bandera, 1 January

Right Sector's military unit includes about fifty citizens of Russia and Belarus.�[95] Members
come from all parts of Ukraine, including the Donbass and Crimea; Russia; other former Soviet
republics; and Western countries.

Ideologically, Volunteer Corps members' political views range from the far right to liberalism to
the far left, including anarchists. Members are Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, pagans
and atheists, and include both men and women of all ages.[96]

In December 2015, group leader Dmytro Yarosh announced that the 5th and 8th battalions, and
the medical battalion, would be incorporated into the Armed Forces of Ukraine following his
departure from Right Sector.[97] The UVC, if possible, would become part of the National Guard
of Ukraine and will in the near future report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs or would be merged
as part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces.

Ideology [ edit ]

Description by the party [ edit ]
The party's ideology is based on the Ukrainian national idea.[1] The party believes that idea of a
nation is more broad than the concept of people as ethnos, yet nothing even close to the
cosmopolitan concept of "political nation".[1] Nation is a conscious and effective unity of people
united around the idea of freedom that is based on ethno-social and spiritually cultural factors.[1]

Ukrainian nationalism is

An ideology of national freedom, freedom of people
and person[1]

An idea and cause in the name of Ukraine[1]

An ideology of defense, preservation, and state
assertion of the Ukrainian nation[1]

A philosophy of national existence [1]

The main component of Right Sector's natiocentric

2015outlook is natio-existential Shevchenko Thought,[1]

based on protection, development, and revival of the
nation based on national imperative or absolute order.[1]

According to its literature, an idealistic worldview is intrinsic to Ukrainian nationalism. [1]

Descriptions in scholarly work [ edit ]
Scholars Andreas Umland and Anton Shekhovstov have written that Right Sector formed as a
loose collection of small groups, outside parliament, that were ultraconservative and included a
neo-Nazi fringe.[37] According to researcher Alina Polyakova, one of Right Sector's constituent
groups, Tryzub, is composed of radical, right-wing nationalists. She writes that the Patriots of
Ukraine, another constituent group, has organized attacks against foreigners or international
students, and is connected to neo-fascist ideology and symbolism; scholar Volodymyr
Ishchenko describes the group as neo-Nazi.[98] Polyakova describes the ideology of the UNA-
UNSO as nationalist, and sometimes including aspects of anarchism.[citation needed]

Shekhovstov has written that Patriot of Ukraine and Social National Assembly, which are racist
and engage in real or symbolic violence against minorities, also oppose alcohol and drug
use.[99] (Also) according to Shekhovtsov "The main peculiarity of the Ukrainian far right is that
its main enemy is not immigrants or national minorities, as often happens with the EU-based far
right, but the Kremlin".[100]

Descriptions in the press [ edit ]
Right Sector has been described by BBC News as a "Ukrainian nationalist group" [19] and an
"umbrella organization of far-right groups".[101] Time has described it as a "radical right-wing
group ... a coalition of militant ultra-nationalists",[23] with an ideology that "borders on fascism".[8]

The New York Times has described it as a "nationalist group" and a "coalition of once-fringe
Ukrainian nationalist groups".[18]

The Guardian has identified it as a "nationalist Ukrainian group";�[102] Reuters as a "far-right
nationalist group";[103] Agence France Presse as a "far-right" group; [26] and the Wall Street
Journal as an "umbrella group for far-right activists and ultranationalists". [104]

Die Welt, the New York Times, and Le Monde Diplomatique  have described some of Right
Sector's constituent groups as radical right-wing, neofascist, or neo-Nazi, but also that is
distanced itself from antisemism.[21][36][39]

Writing for Foreign Policy, Hannah Kozlowska stated that Russian propaganda tried to
demonize the Ukraine government and build a case for the annexation of Crimea by depicting
Right Sector as a powerful neo-Nazi force bent on taking over the government. During the first�
half of 2014, Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in online Russian
mass media.[27]

The Associated Press has called it a "radical ultranationalist group ... demonized by Russian
state propaganda as fascists".[20] The AP reported that it had found no evidence of hate crimes
by the group.[20]

The Russian News & Information Agency  has portrayed Right Sector as a "radical far right
opposition group" and said that "Russian state media have tried to cast the demonstrations as a
predominantly Fascism-inspired movement".[24]

The RT (formerly Russia Today) TV News network has portrayed it as a "Ukrainian radical neo-
fascist" group.[67]

Other Ukrainians and political parties [ edit ]
In an interview, Yarosh stated that Right Sector and Svoboda "have a lot of common positions
when it comes to ideological questions," but that Right Sector "absolutely do[es]n't accept

certain racist things they [Svoboda members] share."[105] Tarasenko cited Stepan Bandera,
stating: "We are enemies to those saying that there [is] no Ukraine, or Ukrainians, or …
Ukrainian language."[106]

According to journalist Oleg Shynkarenko, Yarosh has indicated that Right Sector opposes
homosexuality and has also implied that the right of the nation trumps human rights. [12] The
New York Times has written that "Right Sector, a coalition of ultranationalist and in some cases
neo-Nazi organizations," has attempted to distance itself from anti-Semitism, citing Yarosh's
pledge to fight �racism in Ukraine.[36] According to Spiegel Online, Dmytro Yarosh has stated that
anti-semitism is not a part of Right Sector's ideology.

Tarasenko has stated that the group has no "phobias", that it respects every other nation, and
that it supports the nation state model.[106]

Some Ukrainians in southern and eastern Ukraine view Right Sector negatively and accuse its
members of carrying out a war against the regions on behalf of the government in Kiev.[107] The
group took part in demonstrations in support of Israel in the city of Dnipropetrovsk on 28 July
2014, saying, "We, like Israel, learn unity; learn to love and defend their country, at war with the
most heinous and vile enemy - terrorism."[108]

Attitude towards Europe [ edit ]
Right Sector's website says that its members distrust the "imperial ambitions" of both Russia
and the West.[109] Yarosh told Spiegel Online that anti-Christian organizations are in active
operation in the EU and that the European Commission (rather than the member nation) has
control of lifestyles such as gay marriage.[110] He does not see Europe or NATO as a potential
partner and believes that they are part of a coalition against Ukraine.[110]

Right Sector is the only Ukrainian activist group that opposes joining the European Union. It
regards the EU as an "oppressor" of European nations.[40]

Domestic policy [ edit ]
Right Sector has the position that the population should keep and bear arms, as in
Switzerland.[106] Yarosh told the New York Times that the organization's lawyers were drafting a
bill modeled on Swiss notions of firearms possession.�[88]

Moral issues [ edit ]
According to historian and political scientist Andreas Umland Right Sector is ultra-Christian
conservative and radical nationalist.[3]

On 2 June 2015 the party sent an open letter to Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko asking him to cancel
a pride parade to be held two days later  citing "danger of provocations". [111] The letter also
quoted Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk stating
"Ukraine rejects the false values as gender ideology".[112] The letter also claimed Europeans still
have an ambiguous attitude about "LGBT" stating "in Poland abortion is banned in general, not
to mention same-sex marriages".[112] In a Facebook post Right Sector leader Yarosh claimed
the gay pride parade “spit on the graves of those who died and defended Ukraine”; and he
promised that the group’s members will “put aside other business in order to prevent those who
hate family, morality, and human nature, from executing their plans. We have other things to do,
but we’ll have to deal with this evil too,” he wrote.[113] Right Sector spokesman Artem
Skoropadskyi stated about the pride parade “gay propaganda is destructive and doing harm to
our Christian nation, we can’t allow that”.[113] The pride parade was held; during the march five�
policemen were injured in scuffles after unidentified people attacked the rally with smoke bombs��
and stones.[114] Right Sector denounced the violence; Skoropadskyi stated about it "We can’t
beat weak persons like gays – that’s a disgrace!”.[3]

UNA-UNSO members in Kiev,
January 26, 2014

Volunteer Ukrainian Corps
(DUK), a paramilitary wing of the
Right Sector, among the Donetsk
airport defenders

Component groups [ edit ]
Academic and media sources have described some of Right Sector's constituent groups as
nationalist,[17][115] ultranationalist,[36][116] neofascist,[39] neo-Nazi,[36][98] right-wing,[39] far
right,[99][117] ultraconservative,[37] or paramilitary. A plurality or majority of Right Sector's
members belong to street fighting soccer-fan clubs�[40][41][118] or have no specific affiliation.��

Sich [ edit ]
Sich (Carpathian Sich, Карпатська Січ) is a Cossack battalion from Transcarpathia. Its name
derives from the Ukrainian Cossack term for a command and administrative center.[105][119]

Tryzub (Trident) [ edit ]
Main article: Tryzub

Tryzub is a far-right[8] Ukrainian paramilitary organization founded in 1993 by the Congress of
Ukrainian Nationalists (former Bandera faction of the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists).[120] Its full name is the Stepan Bandera All-Ukrainian Organization ″Tryzub″. It
states that its main goal is to create a Ukrainian united independent state.[citation needed]

According to Tryzub, its enemies in achieving this goal are ″imperialism and chauvinism,
fascism and communism, cosmopolitanism and pseudo-nationalism, totalitarianism and anarchy,
any evil that seeks to parasitize on the sweat and blood of Ukrainians″.[121]

Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National Self-Defense [ edit ]
Main article: Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People's Self-Defence

The Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National
Self-Defense (UNA–UNSO) is a Ukrainian political
organization perceived as far-right in Ukraine and
abroad.[122][123][needs update] The faction supplied a
volunteer battalion that in 1993 participated in the War
in Abkhazia, which was depicted in a documentary film�
"Shadows of War" by Georgiy Gongadze. While the
Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) acted as the
organization's legal political party - wing, on 22 May
2014 it merged into Right Sector.[70] The UNA-UNSO
continues to operate independently.

Legal status [ edit ]
After the start of Ukraine's hostilities with Russia, many
volunteers formed their own groups as territorial defense
battalions. However, these battalions were legal parts of
various Ukrainian security agencies, most of them serving
under the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Interior.
Their volunteers were required to follow orders of the
commanders appointed to these agencies. In May 2014
the group became registered as a social organization
under Ukrainian law.[124][125]

The status of the Volunteer Ukrainian Corps is not official.�

“autonomous nationalists” (http://reactor.org.ua ) and
the neo-Nazi “Patriot of Ukraine”
(http://www.patriotukr.org.ua/ ). For the far right sector
politics of memory actions comprised 29.2% of all
protest actions with their participation, this was larger
than the shares of social-economic, political struggle,
and civic rights protest issues (Table 7)… After the
notorious death of Maksym Chaika in a fight with�
antifascists in Odessa in April 2009, Yushchenko
unambiguously supported the far right interpretation of
the accident claiming the victim to be “an activist of a
patriotic civic association” consciously murdered by “pro-
Russia militants” ignoring Chaika’s connections with
rightist football hooligans and his membership in the
“SICH” (“Glory and Honor”) organization, a participant in
the Social-Nationalist Assembly (http://sna.in.ua/ )
together with the neo-Nazi group “'Patriots of Ukraine.'""

Radical Right-Wing Populism: The Rise of the Ukrainian
Far-Right Party Svoboda.". In Wodak. Right-Wing
Populism in Europe. Bloomsbury Academic. "Svoboda
also seems to benefit from the increasing popularity of�
extreme-right youth movements and organizations like
the Social-National Assembly (SNA), 'Patriot of Ukraine'
and Autonomous Resistance, whose aim is to create 'a
uniracial and uninational society'. The activities of these
groups are not limited to physical or symbolic violence
against ethnic and social minorities, as they also take an
active part in numerous social campaigns - generally
along with representatives of Svoboda - ranging from
mass protests against price rises to leafleting against�
alcohol and drug use. Needless to say, members of
these extreme-right movements are often members of
Tyahnybok's party. Interestingly, 'street combat youth
movements' like the SNA no longer focus on ethnic
issues: in contrast to the older Ukrainian far right, the
new groups are, first and foremost, racist movements.�"

118. ^ Way, Lucan (July 2014). "Civil Society and
Democratization" . Journal of Democracy  25 (3). "It
was only after the start of the protests that various small
parties and factions of the far right joined to form Right
Sector, which came to the fore in the second half of
January, when protests turned violent… Democracy is
most directly undermined by the numerous associations
promoting violence that emerged during the protests.
Such associations include the Right Sector’s
paramilitary formations and the “heavenly hundreds” that
arose to fight the police and the pro-Russian titushki or�
vigilante groups created to harass protesters. Also
problematic are the “ultras,” groups of hardcore soccer
fans that began providing protection for anti-Yanukovych
protesters in January. By promoting vigilante violence
outside state control, such groups directly threaten
democratic development. They facilitate state
breakdown and bloody patterns of aggression and
retribution, making civil war much more likely."
