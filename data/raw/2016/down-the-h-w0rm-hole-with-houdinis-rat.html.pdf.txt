Commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs) -- which are designed, productized and sold to the
casual and experienced hacker alike -- put powerful remote access capabilities into the hands of
criminals. RATs, such as H-W0rm, njRAT, KilerRAT, DarkComet, Netwire, XtremeRAT,

JSocket/AlienSpy/Adwind and others, hold special interest for the Threat Research Team at Fidelis
Cybersecurity. We're constantly following, detecting and monitoring the lifecycle of these RATs as they
appear, disappear and often reappear under a new moniker.
There have been recent reports 1, 2 about a new version of one such commodity RAT, H-W0rm
(Hworm), and the various campaigns it is being used in. Our telemetry shows that H-W0rm is one of
the most active RATs we've seen, with infections observed across virtually all enterprise verticals and
geographies in which Fidelis Cybersecurity products are deployed.
In this blog post, the Threat Research Team at Fidelis Cybersecurity is supplementing these recent
reports by providing the security community with the following:

Technical descriptions of the payload behavior when installed on the victim machine.
Domains observed in active infections over the past six months. We also make a larger
mined dataset available through Fidelis Barncat, a malware configuration intelligence
database shared at no cost with trusted third parties.
Artifacts correlating Hworm C2 domains with njRAT, XtremeRAT and DarkComet.
Yara rules that can be used to detect the VBS and PE versions of H-W0rm.

The following is a screenshot of the Hworm v.1.3 panel and the builder tab:

A Worm That's Really a RAT

It is worth clarifying that even though the malware is known as H-W0rm/Hworm, this version is not a
typical worm. Specifically, it features classic Remote Access Trojan capabilities that allow the adversary
to fully control the infected system. Here is rundown of some of these capabilities:

Collect system information: hardware ID, client name/campaign code, computer name,
operating system, worm/RAT version, information about AV installed, webcam presence,
etc.
File Manager: download, rename, delete, execute
Remote Desktop capture/screenshot
Keylogger
Collect password filled in forms from web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, and Opera
Webcam
Microphone
Run remote application or script from disk or internet, or load it in memory via RunPE
Update RAT from disk or internet
Close connection
Uninstall RAT

 
Let's Go to the Videotape

A YouTube video shows an Hworm version that is referred to as version 2. The following is a
screenshot from one of the windows presented in the video:

The Exploit panel, under the Builder tab, looks interesting. At the moment, it is unclear how this
feature works, but its mere presence suggests the potential for creating and integrating future exploits
into the malware. The following is a screenshot of the panel:

Our analysis found that one of the samples saved keystroke data into the %TEMP% directory
using the filename [malware_name.dat]. In this instance, the malware was configured from the builder
to be installed in the %TEMP% directory, but based on the builder settings, it can be installed in the
following directories:

The malware also created the following hidden folder in the attached USB drive: $RECYCLE.BIN.
 
The Link to Houdini

There has been speculation in the research community 3, 4, 5  that "Houdini" (aka ʻMohamed
Benabdellahʼ) is believed to have connection with “njq8” (aka ʻNaser Al Mutairiʼ), the initial developer
of “njRAT” and “njw0rm”.  It has further been speculated that "Houdini" is based in Algeria and “njq8”
in Kuwait. It is also said that “njq8” has a connection with “Black Mafia” on the development on “Black
Worm”, indicating potential collaboration between these RAT developers.
 
AV Information in the Network Traffic

The network traffic of some versions of the Hworm malware contain information about the antivirus
tool installed in the victim system. This data indicates that some of the infected systems appeared to
have been running antivirus tools like:

Microsoft Security Essentials
Symantec Endpoint Protection
McAfee VirusScan Enterprise
ESET Smart Security
Windows Defender

Normally, those tools will detected the malware, but for some unknown reason it looks like the AV
tools didnʼt remove those versions of the Hworm malware running in memory. Without a copy of the
specific Hworm version in the victim system and a Forensics investigation, it is difficult to confirm why
those AV tools didnʼt remove the sample from those victim system.
 
Protect Yourself

These findings are another validation of how a layered approach to secure the network enterprise is
needed to protect your endpoints from these cyber threats.
In order to aid the security community with indicators of the Hworm RAT, the following is a list of C2
domains we have seen in the past six months:

From the above domains, the following one quickly stands out: “ njrat2012.no-ip[dot]biz”. The last
Hworm activity observed at a client site with this domain was on Oct 2016. pDNS data shows that in
June 2016 this domain was associated with Xtreme RAT activity. We also found samples of njRAT
v.0.7d and v.0.4.1a beaconing to this domain. The following table shows some of the C2 correlations:

XtremeRAT 6b3ef140a6062d7fa295c8fedde7d689 njrat2012.no-ip[dot]biz:22

To aid the security community, we're constantly enriching Fidelis Barncat with newer Hworm
configurations using our mining techniques.
The following Yara rules can also be used to detect this threat:
