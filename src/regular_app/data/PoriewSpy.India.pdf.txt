Hacking Group Spies on Android Users in India Using PoriewSpy
Posted on: January 29, 2018 at 12:00 am Posted in: Mobile, Targeted Attacks
Author:
Mobile Threat Response Team

by Ecular Xu and Grey Guo

We have been seeing attacks that spy on and steal data from specific targets on the mobile platform
since late 2017. We discovered the malicious apps victimizing Android users in India, and believe a
hacking group—one previously known for victimizing government officials—carried out the
attacks. We identified these malicious apps as PoriewSpy (detected by Trend Micro as
ANDROIDOS_PORIEWSPY.HRX). We also suspect that the group used malicious apps built
using DroidJack or SandroRAT (detected as ANDROIDOS_SANRAT.A), based on similarities in
their command-and-control (C&C) server. DroidJack is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allows
intruders to take full control of a user’s Android device when installed.

The operators behind these malicious apps might be related to a suspected cyberespionage group
discovered in 2016, but it’s possible that the group may be launching different attacks unrelated to
their previous campaign.

PoriewSpy turns device into an audio recorder, steals other device info

Existing as far back as 2014, PoriewSpy steals sensitive information from victims’ devices such as
SMS, call logs, contacts, location, and SD card file list. It can also record victims’ voice calls. The
malware was developed from an open-source project called android-swipe-image-viewer, or
Android Image Viewer, which the malware operator/s modified to add the following components:

PoriewSpy apps were automatically downloaded from malicious websites visited by users. When
the malicious app is launched, it will initially show nude photos of an Indian actress, but will later
hide its icon to obscure itself from users’ sight. When the user calls using an infected device, the
malware will start recording the audio, which it saves to /sdcard/.googleplay.security/ named as
“_VoiceCall_” + currentTime. It can also turn the mobile device into an audio recorder to timely
record audio every 60 seconds even when the user is not having a phone call.

Apart from secretly recording audio using the affected device, the malware can also write and steal
contacts, SMS, call logs, and location information.

are outside India or South Asia.

In our research, we also found a malicious app, named after an Indian model-actress, which bears
similarities to the code of PoriewSpy apps. Created in 2014, we speculate that this is an earlier
version of PoriewSpy that also shares the same C&C server with some of the latest ones. The
malicious app is capable of stealing call logs, contacts, SMS, SD card file list, and audio recording.

Malicious apps developed using DroidJack

Apps built using DroidJack also appear to have been used by the hacking group behind PoriewSpy,
based on the C&C servers they share. The operators disguised these DroidJack-built apps as
freeCall, BatterySavor, Secure_Comm, and Nexus_Compatability.

The malicious apps are capable of obtaining all necessary permissions for an Android device’s
main functions, including accessing, modifying, and executing calls, SMS, phonebook, camera,
audio recorder, as well as enable or disable Wi-Fi connectivity.

The C&C servers of PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps

Some of PoriewSpy’s C&C servers were located at 5[.]189[.]137[.]8 and 5[.]189[.]145[.]248, while
some of the DroidJack-built apps’ were at 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 and 88[.]150[.]227[.]71. Our
research revealed that these four C&C servers were previously used by a hacking group who
allegedly engaged in cyberespionage activities. The abused IPs 5[.]189[.]137[.]8,
5[.]189[.]145[.]248, and 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 can be traced back to a legitimate hosting service
provider based in Germany. Meanwhile, 88[.]150[.]227[.]71’s is in the UK. 62[.]4[.]2[.]211, the
C&C server of the initial version of PoriewSpy used by some of the latest versions, belongs to a
service provider in France. The hacking group also used draagon[.]ddns[.]net, located in South
Asia.

Figure 10. The chart above shows the connections between the C&C servers of PoriewSpy and
DroidJack-built apps, and the suspected cyberespionage group. The green dots represent the

current malicious samples. IPs colored in yellow are the ones used by the group in their previous
campaign, while the ones in red are presumably the extension to the mobile platform.

The period PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps became active also appear to match that of the
hacking group’s campaign. It was observed that the activities of the abovementioned mobile
malware became active in late 2015 to early 2016, which was around the same period the hacking
group’s campaign was also active.

Countermeasures

Targeted attacks on mobile devices may be few compared to ones for desktops or PCs, but the
discovery of PoriewSpy and other malicious apps that spy on the mobile platform should caution
users of the threat that may come their way if their devices remain unsecured. Downloading only
from legitimate app stores can prevent PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps from compromising
your mobile device. It is also important to be aware of what apps are allowed to access, and
to understand the risks before accepting any terms or granting certain permissions to apps.

We disclosed our findings to Google, who stated that none of the abovementioned malicious apps
are on Google Play. Updates were made to Google Play Protect to defend against new and existing
similar threats.
