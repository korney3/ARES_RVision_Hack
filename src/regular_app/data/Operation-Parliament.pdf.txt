Operation Parliament, who is doing what? - Securelist


SummarySummary
Kaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early 2017 . The

attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations. The objective of

the attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial

bodies around the world.

1. The attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017 , with the

main focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine. High-profile

organizations have also been targeted in other regions. The number of attacks has decreased

since the beginning of 2018.

2. The attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted political

f igures in the MENA region. At f irst the attacks looked to be the work of the low-sophistication

Gaza Cybergang (decoys, f ile names), but further analysis painted a very different picture.

3. Targets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state off ices and off icials,

political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research

centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other

unknown entities.

4. The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling

them to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HTTP requests.

5. Kaspersky Lab users and Threat Management and Defense clients are protected from the attacks.

Cisco Talos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East region which

we believe may be connected.

Victimology and StatisticsVictimology and Statistics
Based on our f indings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically

motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017 , with the attackers doing just enough to

achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have

access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide,

especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff . The victim systems range from personal desktop or

laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted

ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, f inance

and so on.

Victims have been spotted in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,

Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK,

Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark.

The number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the attacks

– only a portion.

Attack description and attributionAttack description and attribution
Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East

region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in

the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the

infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed

down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was

obtained. The targeting of specif ic victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by

Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that

was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).

With deception and false f lags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and

complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.

See the following for more information and examples of false f lags being used in cyberattacks:

Malware descriptionMalware description
The malware was f irst seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show any

similarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted and

obfuscated. Functionality was identif ied that enables HTTP communication with the C&C server and

invokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.

The configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to the C&C

server is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local and network

encryption.

The malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about the

infected machine. The C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized configuration.

The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling them

to execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HTTP requests.

What should high-profile organizationsWhat should high-profile organizations
do?do?
High-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them are

inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. These organizations need to pay particular attention to their

security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well protected. Anti-targeted attack

solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data f lows, default-deny application lockdown, endpoint

detection and response, data leak and insider threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped

networks should form the basis of any strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat

landscape.
