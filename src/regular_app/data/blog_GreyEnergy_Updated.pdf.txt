GreyEnergy: Updated arsenal of one of the most
dangerous threat actors

ESET research reveals a successor to the infamous BlackEnergy APT group targeting
critical infrastructure, quite possibly in preparation for damaging attacks

Recent ESET research has uncovered details of the successor of the BlackEnergy APT
group, whose main toolset was last seen in December 2015 during the first-ever blackout
caused by a cyberattack. Around the time of that breakthrough incident, when around
230,000 people were left without electricity, we started detecting another malware
framework and named it GreyEnergy. It has since been used to attack energy companies
and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland for the past three years.

It is important to note that when we describe ‘APT groups’, we’re making connections
based on technical indicators such as code similarities, shared C&C infrastructure,
malware execution chains, and so on. We’re typically not directly involved in the
investigation and identification of the individuals writing the malware and/or deploying it,
and the interpersonal relations between them. Furthermore, the term ‘APT group’ is very
loosely defined, and often used merely to cluster the abovementioned malware indicators.
This is also one of the reasons why we refrain from speculation with regard to attributing
attacks to nation states and such.

We have already extensively documented the threat actors’ transition towards TeleBots in
cyberattacks on high-value targets in the Ukrainian financial sector , the supply-chain
attacks against Ukraine and in an analysis of TeleBots’ cunning backdoor. All from the
group most notable for the NotPetya ransomware outbreak. At the same time, we have
also been keeping a close eye on GreyEnergy – a subgroup operating in parallel, but with
somewhat different motivations and targeting.

Although ESET telemetry data shows GreyEnergy malware activity over the last three
years, this APT group has not been documented until now. This is probably due to the fact
that those activities haven’t been destructive in nature, unlike the numerous TeleBots
ransomware campaigns (not only NotPetya), the BlackEnergy-enabled power grid attack,
and the Industroyer-caused blackout – which we have linked to these groups  for the first
time last week. Instead, the threat actors behind GreyEnergy have tried to stay under the
radar, focusing on espionage and reconnaissance, quite possibly in preparation of future
cybersabotage attacks or laying the groundwork for an operation run by some other APT
group.

GreyEnergy’s malware framework bears many similarities to BlackEnergy, as outlined
below. It is similarly modular in construction, so its functionality is dependent on the
particular combination of modules its operator uploads to each of the targeted victim
systems. The modules that we have observed were used for espionage and
reconnaissance purposes (i.e. backdoor, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging,

password and credential stealing, etc.). We have not observed any modules that
specifically target Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We have, however, observed that the
GreyEnergy operators have been strategically targeting ICS control workstations running
SCADA software and servers, which tend to be mission-critical systems never meant to go
offline except for periodic maintenance.

Links to BlackEnergy and TeleBots
Some of the reasons ESET researchers consider BlackEnergy and GreyEnergy related are
listed below:

The appearance of GreyEnergy in the wild coincides with the disappearance of
BlackEnergy.
At least one of the victims targeted by GreyEnergy had been targeted by BlackEnergy
in the past. Both subgroups share an interest in the energy sector and critical
infrastructure. Both have had victims primarily in Ukraine, with Poland ranking
second.
There are strong architectural similarities between the malware frameworks. Both
are modular, and both employ a “mini”, or light, backdoor deployed before admin
rights are obtained and the full version is deployed.
All remote C&C servers used by the GreyEnergy malware were active Tor relays. This
has also been the case with BlackEnergy and Industroyer. We hypothesize that this
is an operational security technique used by the group so that the operators can
connect to these servers in a covert manner.

Compared to BlackEnergy, GreyEnergy is a more modern toolkit with an even greater focus
on stealth. One basic stealth technique – employed by both families – is to push only
selected modules to selected targets, and only when needed. On top of that, some
GreyEnergy modules are partially encrypted using AES-256 and some remain fileless –
running only in memory – with the intention of hindering analysis and detection. To cover
their tracks, typically, GreyEnergy’s operators securely wipe the malware components from
the victims’ hard drives.

In addition to the outlined similarities with BlackEnergy, we have observed another link
between GreyEnergy and the TeleBots subgroup. In December 2016, we noticed an
instance of GreyEnergy deploying an early version of the TeleBots’ NotPetya worm – half a
year before it was altered, improved, and deployed in the most damaging ransomware
outbreak in history. There is significant code reuse between this ransomware component
and the GreyEnergy core module. We call this early version “Moonraker Petya”, based on
the malware writers’ choice of filename – most likely a reference to the James Bond
movie. It didn’t feature the infamous EternalBlue spreading mechanism, as it had not been
leaked at that time.

GreyEnergy Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
We have observed two distinct infection vectors: “traditional” spearphishing, and the
compromise of public-facing web servers. When such a vulnerable web server was hosted
internally and connected to the rest of a targeted organization’s network, the attacker
would attempt to move laterally to other workstations. This technique is used not only as a
primary infection vector but also as a backup reinfection vector.

The attackers typically deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims’ networks. Such
proxy C&Cs redirect requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C
server on the internet.  This is another stealth tactic, as it is less suspicious to a defender
to see that multiple computers are “talking” to an internal server, rather than a remote one.

A very curious observation – one that is also indicative of the group’s targeting – is that
some of the GreyEnergy samples we detected were signed with a certificate from
Advantech, a Taiwanese manufacturer of industrial and IoT hardware. These were most
likely stolen from the company, just as in the case of Stuxnet and a recent Plead malware
campaign.

The GreyEnergy operators also employ common external tools in their arsenal, such as
Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
