New KillDisk Variant Hits Financial Organizations in Latin
America

We came across a new variant of the disk-wiping KillDisk targeting
financial organizations in Latin America. Trend Micro detects it as
TROJ_KILLDISK.IUB. Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ proactively
blocks any intrusions or attacks associated with this threat. Initial
analysis (which is still ongoing) reveals that it may be a component
of another payload, or part of a bigger attack. We are still analyzing
this new KillDisk variant and we will update this post as we uncover
more details about this threat.

KillDisk, along with the multipurpose, cyberespionage-related BlackEnergy, was used in cyberattacks in
late December 2015 against Ukraine’s energy sector as well as its banking, rail, and mining industries.
The malware has since metamorphosed into a threat used for digital extortion, affecting Windows and
Linux platforms. The ransom note, like in the case of Petya, was a ruse: Because KillDisk overwrites
and deletes files (and doesn’t store the encryption keys on disk or online), recovering the scrambled
files was out of the question.

Figure 1: KillDisk’s infection chain

How is it dropped in the system?
This KillDisk variant looks like it is intentionally dropped by another process/attacker. Its file path is
hardcoded in the malware (c:\windows\dimens.exe), which means that it is tightly coupled with its
installer or is a part of a bigger package.

Figure 2: The new KillDisk variant’s parameter to shut down the affected machine

KillDisk also has a self-destruct process, although it isn’t really deleting itself. It renames its file to
c:\windows\0123456789 while running. This string is hardcoded in the sample we analyzed. It expects
its file path to be c:\windows\dimens.exe (also hardcoded). Accordingly, if disk forensics is performed
and dimens.exe is searched, the file that will be retrieved will be the newly created file with 0x00 byte
content.

Ifthe logical drive contains the system directory, the files and folders in the following directories andsubdirectories are exempted from deletion:WINNTUsersWindowsProgram FilesProgram Files (x86)ProgramDataRecovery (case-sensitive check)$Recycle.BinSystem Volume InformationoldPerfLogsBefore a file is deleted, it is first randomly renamed. KillDisk will overwrite the first 0x2800 bytes of thefile and another block that’s 0x2800-bytes big with 0x00.Figure 3: Code snippets showing how KillDisk overwrites then deletes filesHow does it wipe the disk?The malware attempts to wipe \\.\PhysicalDrive0 to \\.\PhysicalDrive4. It reads the Master Boot Record(MBR) of every device it successfully opens and proceeds to overwrite the first 0x20 sectors of thedevice with “0x00”. It uses the information from the MBR to do further damage to the partitions it lists. Ifthe partition it finds is not an extended one, it overwrites the first 0x10 and last sectors of the actualvolume. If it finds an extended partition, it will overwrite the Extended Boot Record (EBR) along with thetwo extra partitions it points to.

EBR (bottom)

What happens after the MBR, files, and folders are overwritten and/or deleted?

KillDisk has a numeric parameter that denotes the number of minutes (15 being the default) it will wait
before it shuts down the affected machine. To try to reboot the machine, it will try to terminate these
processes:

Client/server run-time subsystem (csrss.exe)

Windows Start-Up Application (wininit.exe)

Windows Logon Application (winlogon.exe)

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe)

This is done most likely to force a reboot or dupe the user into restarting the machine. Terminating
csrss.exe and wininit.exe, for instance, will cause a blue screen of death (BSOD). Terminating
winlogon.exe will prompt the user to log in again, while terminating lsass.exe will cause a reboot.
KillDisk also uses the ExitWindowsEx function to forcefully restart the machine.

What can organizations do?
KillDisk’s destructive capabilities, and how it could be just a part of a bigger attack, highlight the
significance of defense in depth: securing the perimeters — from gateways, endpoints, and networks to
servers — to further reduce the attack surface. Here are some best practices for organizations.

Keep the system and its applications updated/patched to deter attackers from exploiting security
gaps; consider virtual patching for legacy systems.

Regularly back up data and ensure its integrity.

Enforce the principle of least privilege. Network segmentation and data categorization help prevent
lateral movement and further exposure.

Deploy security mechanisms such as application control/whitelisting and behavior monitoring,
which can block suspicious programs from running and thwart anomalous system modifications.

Proactively monitor the system and network; enable and employ firewalls as well as intrusion
prevention and detection systems.

Implement a managed incident response policy that will drive proactive remediation strategies;
further strengthen the organization’s security posture by cultivating a cybersecurity-aware
workplace.
