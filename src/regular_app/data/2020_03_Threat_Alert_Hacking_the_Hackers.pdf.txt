W H AT ’S H AP P ENING? 
Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a campaign where attackers are trojanizing 

multiple hacking tools with njRat, a well known RAT. The campaign ultimately gives 

attackers total access to the target machine.

In this writeup, the Nocturnus team presents an analysis of the attacker TTPs  

and indicators of compromise. During this investigation, we uncovered hundreds 

of trojanized files and information about the threat actors infrastructure.

K E Y OB SER VAT IONS & T T P S
» A Widespread Campaign: The Nocturnus team has found a widespread hacking 

campaign that uses the njRat trojan to hijack the victim’s machine, giving the 

threat actors complete access that can be used for anything from conducting 

DDoS attacks to stealing sensitive data.

» Baiting Hackers: The malware is spreading by turning various hacking tools 
and other installers into trojans. The threat actors are posting the maliciously 

modified files on various forums and websites to bait other hackers.

» Using Vulnerable Wordpress Sites: The threat actors are hacking vulnerable 
WordPress installations to host their malicious njRat payloads. 

» Creating a “Malware Factory”: It seems as if the threat actors behind this 
campaign are building new iterations of their hacking tools on a daily basis.
