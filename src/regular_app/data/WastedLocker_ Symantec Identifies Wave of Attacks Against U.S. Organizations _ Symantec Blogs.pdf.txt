WastedLocker: Symantec Identifies Wave of Attacks Against
U.S. Organizations

symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us

Symantec, a division of Broadcom, has identified and alerted our customers to a string of
attacks against U.S. companies by attackers attempting to deploy the WastedLocker
ransomware (Ransom.WastedLocker) on their networks. The end goal of these attacks is
to cripple the victim’s IT infrastructure by encrypting most of their computers and servers
in order to demand a multimillion dollar ransom. At least 31 customer organizations have
been attacked, meaning the total number of attacks may be much higher. The attackers
had breached the networks of targeted organizations and were in the process of laying the
groundwork for staging ransomware attacks.

WastedLocker is a relatively new breed of targeted ransomware, documented just prior to
our publication by NCC Group, while Symantec was performing outreach to affected
networks. WastedLocker has been attributed to the notorious “Evil Corp” cyber crime
outfit. Evil Corp has previously been associated with the Dridex banking Trojan and
BitPaymer ransomware, which are believed to have earned their creators tens of millions
of dollars. Two Russian men who are alleged to be involved in the group have open
indictments against them in the U.S.

The attacks begin with a malicious JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish,
tracked to more than 150 compromised websites, which masquerades as a software
update. Once the attackers gain access to the victim’s network, they use Cobalt Strike
commodity malware in tandem with a number of living-off-the-land tools to steal
credentials, escalate privileges, and move across the network in order to deploy the
WastedLocker ransomware on multiple computers.

Discovery
The attacks were proactively detected on a number of customer networks by Symantec’s
Targeted Attack Cloud Analytics, which leverages advanced machine learning to spot
patterns of activity associated with targeted attacks. The activity was reviewed by
Symantec’s Threat Hunter team (part of Symantec’s Endpoint Security Complete
offering) who verified it and quickly realized it corresponded closely to publicly
documented activity seen in the early stages of WastedLocker attacks.

This discovery enabled us to identify further organizations that had been targeted by
WastedLocker and identify additional tools, tactics, and procedures used by the attackers,
helping us to strengthen our protection against every stage of the attack.

and Response (EDR) customers, warning them of early stage WastedLocker activity on their networks

Major corporations in the crosshairs
Symantec has uncovered attacks against 31 organizations to date, all of which were
located in the U.S. The vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many
household names. Aside from a number of large private companies, there were 11 listed
companies, eight of which are Fortune 500 companies. All but one of the targeted
organizations are U.S. owned, with the exception being a U.S.-based subsidiary of an
overseas multinational.

Figure 2. WastedLocker targets by industry sector

Organizations in a diverse range of sectors were attacked. Manufacturing was the sector
most affected, accounting for five targeted organizations. This was followed by
Information Technology (four) and Media and Telecommunications (three). Had the
attackers not been disrupted, successful attacks could have led to millions in damages,
downtime, and a possible domino effect on supply chains.

How WastedLocker attacks unfold
The initial compromise of an organization involves the SocGholish framework, which is
delivered to the victim in a zipped file via compromised legitimate websites. Symantec has
discovered at least 150 different legitimate websites that refer traffic to websites hosting
the SocGholish zip file. It is possible that these websites lead to different malware, as such
redirection services can be utilized by multiple actors at the same time.

The zipped file contains malicious JavaScript, masquerading as a browser update. A
second JavaScript file is then executed by wscript.exe. This JavaScript first profiles the
computer using commands such as whoami, net user, and net group, then uses
PowerShell to download additional discovery related PowerShell scripts.

The next stage of the attack is to deploy Cobalt Strike. PowerShell is used to download
and execute a loader from a domain publicly reported as being used to deliver Cobalt
Strike as part of WastedLocker attacks. The loader also shared a command and control
(C&C) domain with this reported Cobalt Strike infrastructure. The loader contained a
.NET injector, also reportedly seen in WastedLocker attacks. The injector, along with the
loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon, is reportedly taken from an open-source project called
Donut, which is designed to help inject and execute in-memory payloads.

The injected payload is known as Cobalt Strike Beacon and can be used to execute
commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes or impersonate other
processes, and upload and download files. The Get-NetComputer command
from PowerView is renamed by the attackers to a random name. This command was then
seen searching for all the computer objects in the Active Directory database with filter
condition like *server* or *2003* or *7* (returning all Windows Server, Windows Server
2003, or Windows 7 instances). The attackers then logged this information in a .tmp file.

Privilege escalation was performed using a publicly documented technique involving the
Software Licensing User Interface tool (slui.exe), a Windows command line utility that is
responsible for activating and updating the Windows operating system.

The attackers used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility
(wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers, such as adding a new user or
executing additional downloaded PowerShell scripts. Cobalt Strike was also used to carry
out credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files.

In order to deploy the ransomware, the attackers use the Windows Sysinternals tool
PsExec to launch a legitimate command line tool for managing Windows Defender
(mpcmdrun.exe) to disable scanning of all downloaded files and attachments, remove all
installed definitions, and, in some cases, disable real-time monitoring.

It is possible that the attackers use more than one technique to perform this task, since
NCC reported suspected use of a tool called SecTool checker for this purpose.

PsExec is then used to launch PowerShell which uses the win32_service WMI class to
retrieve services and the net stop command to stop these services. After Windows
Defender is disabled and services have been stopped across the organization, PsExec is
used to launch the WastedLocker ransomware itself, which then begins encrypting data
and deleting shadow volumes.

Immediate threat to corporations
The attackers behind this threat appear to be skilled and experienced, capable of
penetrating some of the most well protected corporations, stealing credentials, and
moving with ease across their networks. As such, WastedLocker is a highly dangerous
piece of ransomware. A successful attack could cripple the victim’s network, leading to
significant disruption to their operations and a costly clean-up operation.
