Cisco Talos has identified a highly targeted campaign against 13 iPhones which appears to be
focused on India. The attacker deployed an open-source mobile device management (MDM)
system to control enrolled devices. At this time, we don't know how the attacker managed to enroll
the targeted devices. Enrollment could be done through physical access to the devices, or most
likely by using social engineering to entice a user to register. In social engineering attacks the victim
is tricked into clicking accept or giving the attacker physical access to a device. This campaign is of
note since the malware goes to great lengths to replace specific mobile apps for data interception.
Talos has worked closely with Apple on countering this threat. Apple had already actioned 3
certificates associated with this actor when Talos reached out, and quickly moved to action the two
others once Talos tied them to the threat.

An MDM is designed to deploy applications on enrolled devices. In this campaign we identified five
applications that have been distributed by this system to the 13 targeted devices in India. Two of
them appear to test the functionality of the device, one steals SMS message contents, and the
remaining two report the location of the device and can exfiltrate various data.

The attacker used the BOptions sideloading technique to add features to legitimate apps, including
the messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram, that were then deployed by the MDM onto the 13
targeted devices in India. The purpose of the BOptions sideloading technique is to inject a dynamic
library in the application. The malicious code inserted into these apps is capable of collecting and
exfiltrating information from the device, such as the phone number, serial number, location,
contacts, user's photos, SMS and Telegram and WhatsApp chat messages. Such information can
be used to manipulate a victim or even use it for blackmail or bribery.

Thanks to the logs located on the MDM servers and the malware's command and control (C2)
server, we were able to determine that the malware has been in use since August 2015. The
campaign targeted only a few select devices (13) that are all located in India. The attacker left
essential data on the servers, such as emails and usernames. As part of the attacker's
development and testing it appears that they compromised their device — we observed a device
named "test" or "mdmdev." The log files we identified contain the phone number of the device. The
number originates from India and uses the "Vodafone India" network with roaming capability
disabled. With all of this information in mind, we assume with high confidence that the malware
author works out of India.

MDM is becoming more popular throughout large enterprises, and users should be aware that
installing additional certificates on their device to allow remote management can result in potential
malicious activity. By installing a certificate outside of the Apple iOS trusted certificate chain, you
may open up to possible third-party attacks like this. Users must be aware that accepting an MDM
certificate is equivalent to allowing someone administrator access to their device, passwords, etc.
This must be done with great care in order to avoid security issues and should not be something
the average home user does.

The following information warns the security community and users of how this attack works. The
likely use of social engineering to recruit devices serves as a reminder that users need to be wary of
clicking on unsolicited links and verify identities and legitimacy of requests to access devices.

The overall workflow of the deployment method and capabilities is pictured below.

Both servers above are based on the open-source project mdm-server — a small iOS MDM server.
MDM allows for operating system-level control of multiple devices from a centralized location. A
remote administrator can install or remove apps, install or revoke certificates, lock the device, or
change password requirements, among other things. The operator is able to uninstall legitimate
applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp to install the malicious versions described in the next
section.

Each step of the enrollment process needs some type of user interaction. That's why Talos
assumes the attackers use social engineering to get victims on the MDM. The first step for
enrolling a device is to install the certificate authority:

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The attacker is now able to control the device. A pop-up appears when the attacker pushes a new
app to the user device. Here is an example with the compromised Telegram app mentioned later in
the article:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u1r-X1VThZg/W0eCrZtilXI/AAAAAAAAAdc/gA6srrGF5hk2jvUXNWGageR7EiEAqlZtACLcBGAs/s1600/image5.png
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


This gives the attacker a significant level of control over the victim device(s). This process is used
similarly to a large-scale enterprise using MDM solutions. It is likely that the user is advised that the
certificate must be installed to allow enrollment. This is most likely performed via a social
engineering mechanism, i.e. a fake tech support-style call.

The attacker used a domain which allowed them to try and fool the user. The use of "ios-certificate-
update[.]com" may make it easier to reassure the user that this is normal. Since we believe this
attack is targeting devices in India this is also something which a non-native English speaker may
see as "normal." The certificate and update naming convention is also designed to trick the user.

The attacker left a lot of information behind, which allowed us to analyse files used by this MDM.
First, the certificate used by the MDM:

CA.crt:

Serial Number: 13905745817900070731 (0xc0fb222544ceb74b)

Technical information about the MDM

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The certificate was issued in September 2017 and contains an email address located in Russia. Our
investigation suggests that the attacker is not based out of Russia. We assume this is a false flag
to point researchers toward the idea of a "classical Russian hacker." False flags are becoming more
common in malware, both sophisticated and simple. It's an attempt to muddy the waters for the
analysts/researchers to direct blame elsewhere.

Identity.p12:

Serial Number: 14177612590375883362 (0xc4c0ff88e475d262)

Subject: C=CR, ST=Split, L=Split, O=NA, OU=IT, CN=ios-certificate-
update.com/emailAddress=Aleksi.Dushku@mail.ru

This is another certificate, which points to an apparent reference to Russia by using another mail.ru
address.

Server.csr:

Subject: C=HR, ST=Hrvatska, L=Split, O=NA, OU=IT, CN=ios-certificate-
update.com/emailAddress=nicholas.vukoja@mail.ru

In this certificate, the attacker mentioned Hrvatska ("Croatia" in the Croatian language) with the
same Russian email.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The certificates are self-signed, or signed by the Comodo certificate authority.

One of the most interesting pieces of information about the MDM is found in the log file. Because of
this, we can confirm the following points:

There are 13 compromised devices based off serial number
All the devices are located in India (based on the phone numbers and phone providers)
Phone models: iPhone 5.4, iPhone 7.2, iPhone 8.1, iPhone 8.2, iPhone 9.3, iPhone 9.4
iOS versions: 10.2.1, 10.3.1, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, 11.0, 11.0.3, 11.2.1, 11.2.5, 11.2.6

At this time, we don't know how the attacker enrolled the 13 targeted devices into the MDM. It could
be through physical access to the phones, or by using social engineering, motivating the user to
enroll their device.

We believe the attackers used their personal phone to test the MDM because they included devices
named "Test" and "mdmdev." These two devices share the same phone number and a name that is
uncommon for a personal phone.

The phone number originates from India and is registered on the "Vodafone India" network provider.
When the device was registered on the MDM server, roaming was disabled. We assess with high
confidence that the author is based out of in India.

The attacker's purpose appears to deploy malicious apps onto the 13 compromised devices. To do

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


The attacker's purpose appears to deploy malicious apps onto the 13 compromised devices. To do
so, they decided to use the BOptions sideloading technique. The technique is described here. The
purpose is to inject a dynamic library into the legitimate app. The GitHub project was used by the
attacker to create the malicious BOptionspro.dylib library held in the iOS package (.ipa file). The
injection library can ask for additional permissions, execute code and steal information from the
original application, among other things. Milan-based technology company HackingTeam has
previously used this technique.

In this campaign we identified three compromised versions of apps using this trick hosted on the
MDM server. AppsSLoader is seemingly harmless. The app was created to test the library injection.
It simply opens a pop-up to the user confirming the execution of the dynamic library. This was most
likely created to test the effectiveness of the library prior to malicious deployment.

The compromised versions of the Telegram and WhatsApp applications used in this campaign are
more interesting and relevant. They first contain the same malicious code. The purpose is to send
collected data to a C2 server located at hxxp[:]//techwach[.]com.

The malicious code checks permissions and asks for additional permissions if it does not already
have them:

Permission to access the user's contact list (PhnNumber::getContAccess)
Permission to access the user's photos (PhnNumber::getPAccess)

Permission to access the user's photos (PhnNumber::getPAccess)

One of the most relevant features of these compromised versions of the applications is the
Telegram and WhatsApp message stealing feature. Here is the global workflow of it:

For Telegram:

Opens 'tgdata.db', an SQLite3 database used by Telegram
Checks for the key 'UPLOADED_CHAT' in the key store
Queries "select users_v29.phone_number, users_v29.uid from users_v29;"
Queries for "select messages_v29.from_id AS oid,users_v29.first_name,

Parses results, storing off counts, timestamps, and other metadata.

Additionally, the malware is designed to be able to send the contacts, location, and images from the
compromised device.

Here is the list of the PHP pages available on the techwach C2 server:

all.php
dyrKztORKwVWOGo.php
get.php
hh.php
info.php
jDRucchWSoWQGpU.php
UfmcRxYDaVVbrBl.php

Another intriguing aspect of this malware is the way in which the malicious code achieves periodic
code execution when the legitimate app bundled with it is running. One technique is to modify the
app's code at runtime to execute the malicious code — this has been observed in previously
analyzed iOS malware. Instead, this malware remains almost entirely independent of the app and
gains execution by creating a timer that eventually executes the malicious code in a background
thread. From there, it schedules tasks to be executed asynchronously in the background by
leveraging the apps' background task queue. Ultimately, this means that the malicious code is
invisible to the user of the app, and can be easily reused alongside any real application.

Talos identified another legitimate app executing malicious code during this campaign in India.
PrayTime is used to give the user a notification when it's time to pray. The malicious code connects
to the domain voguextra[.]com. The purpose is to download and display specific ads to the user.

PRAYTIME

This app also leverages private frameworks to read the SMS messages on the device it is installed
on and uploads these to the C2 server.

MyApp is a regular iOS app. However, the application does not do anything. It has almost no code
associated with it other than standard iOS app runtime code. This could potentially be another
testing app, but we're unable to determine the exact use. This app is non-malicious.

The malicious code within Telegram and WhatsApp sent collected data to the server
techwach[.]com. The server has been active since August 2015. Initially, the username used on the
server was arnoldrex. Subsequently, this was changed to chernobog (referencing a Slavic deity).

This investigation shows us that this attack targeted a very limited number (13) of users using
iPhone devices in India. At the time, it is unclear who the targets of the campaign were, who was
the perpetrator, or what the exact purpose was. It's very likely the vector for this campaign was
simply social engineering - in other words asking the user to click "ok". This type of vector is very
difficult to defend against since users can often be tricked into acting against their best interests.
This is another important reminder that users must think twice before clicking on unsolicited links or
requests and also that users should verify credentials from any unsolicited calls requesting they
take action on devices.

The attackers installed an open-source MDM and used this to deploy malicious code into secure

The attackers installed an open-source MDM and used this to deploy malicious code into secure
chat applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp to surreptitiously retrieve the messages/chats,
photos and user's location from the victim's phone. Over a three-year period, the attackers
remained under the radar — likely due to the low number of compromised devices. All the technical
details point to an actor based in the same country as the victims: India. The attacker tried to mimic
Russian hackers by using mail.ru email. However, we found testing devices enrolled on the MDM
with an Indian phone number and registered on an Indian provider.

Once a user has lost physical access to their phone, it's really a case of the attacker having a much
easier playing field for malicious activity. The fact that the attacker was also able to get devices
onto his own malicious MDM shows that the attacker was indeed motivated to obtain initial access
but also to maintain persistence across the devices.

Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.

Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally
suited to prevent the execution of the malware
used by these threat actors.

Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) or Web
Security Appliance (WSA) web scanning
prevents access to malicious websites and
detects malware used in these attacks.

Email Security can block malicious emails sent
by threat actors as part of their campaign.

Network Security appliances such as Next-
Generation Firewall (NGFW), Next-Generation

Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS), and Meraki MX can detect malicious activity associated with
this threat.

AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security
products.

Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious domains,
IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.

Open Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the latest
rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.
