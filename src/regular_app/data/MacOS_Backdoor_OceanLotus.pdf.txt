New MacOS Backdoor Linked to OceanLotus Found

Posted on: April 4, 2018 at 9:00 am Posted in: Targeted Attacks
Author: Jaromir Horejsi (Threat Researcher)

We identified a MacOS backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as
 OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D) that we believe is the latest version of
a threat used by OceanLotus (a.k.a. APT 32, APT-C-00,
SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty). OceanLotus was responsible for
launching targeted attacks against human rights organizations,
media organizations, research institutes, and maritime
construction firms. The attackers behind OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D
target MacOS computers which have the Perl programming
language installed.

The MacOS backdoor was found in a malicious Word document
presumably distributed via email. The document bears the
filename “2018-PHIẾU  GHI  DANH  THAM  DỰ  TĨNH  HỘI HMDC 2018.doc,” which translates to
“2018-REGISTRATION FORM OF HMDC ASSEMBLY 2018.doc.” The document claims to be a
registration form for an event with HDMC, an organization in Vietnam that advertises national
independence and democracy.

Upon receiving the malicious document, the user is advised to enable macros. In our analysis, the
macro is obfuscated, character by character, using the decimal ASCII code. This is shown in the
figure below.

Figure 2. Code snippet of the obfuscated document

After deobfuscation, we can see that the payload is written in the Perl programming language. It
extracts theme0.xml file from the Word document. theme0.xml is a Mach-O 32-bit executable with a
 0xFEEDFACE signature that is also the dropper of the backdoor, which is the final payload.
theme0.xml is extracted to /tmp/system/word/theme/syslogd before it’s executed.

Dropper analysis

The dropper is used to install the backdoor into the infected system and establish its persistence.

Figure 4. The main function of the dropper

All strings within the dropper, as well as the backdoor, are encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256
key. There are two forms of encrypted strings: an RSA256-encrypted string, and custom base64-
encoded and RSA256-encrypted string.

Figure 5. Hardcoded RSA256 key showing the first 20 characters

Using the setStartup() method, the dropper first checks if it is running as a root or not. Based on
that, the GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the hardcoded
path and filename where the backdoor should be installed. The locations:

For root user

path: /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/iOSScreenCapture.plugin/Contents/Resources/
processname: screenassistantd

For regular user

path: ~/Library/Spelling/
processname: spellagentd

Subsequently, it implements the Loader::installLoader method, reading the hardcoded 64-bit
Mach-O executable (magic value 0xFEEDFACF), and writing to the previously determined path
and file.

Figure 6. The dropper installs the backdoor, sets its attributes to “hidden”, and sets a random file

date and time

When the dropper installs the backdoor, it sets its attributes to “hidden” and sets file date and time
to  random values using the touch command: touch –t YYMMDDMM “/path/filename” > /dev/null.
The access permissions will then be changed to 0x1ed = 755, which is equal to u=rwx,go=rx.

Figure 7. The magic value 0xFEEDFACF that belongs to Mach-O Executable (64 bit)

Methods GET_LAUNCHNAME and GET_LABELNAME will return the hardcoded name of the
property list “.plist” for the root user (com.apple.screen.assistantd.plist) and for the regular user
(com.apple.spell.agent.plist).

Afterwards, the persistence file will be created in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or
~/Library/LaunchAgents/  folder. The RunAtLoad key will command launchd to run the daemon
when the operating system starts up, while the KeepAlive key will command launchd to let the
process run indefinitely. This persistence file is also set to hidden with a randomly generated file
date and time.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


~/Library/LaunchAgents/ filename.plist > /dev/nul will then command the operating system to start
the dropped backdoor file at login. The dropper will delete itself at the end of the process.

Backdoor analysis

The main loop of the backdoor has two main functions, infoClient and runHandle. infoClient is
reponsible for collecting OS info, submitting this info to its C&C servers (the servers are malicious
in nature), and receiving additional C&C communication information. Meanwhile, runHandle is
responsible for the backdoor capabilities.

Figure 9. The main functions of the backdoor

infoClient fills up the variables in HandlePP class.

Figure 10. List of variables belonging to the HandlePP class

clientID is an MD5 hash derived from the environment variables, while strClientID is a hexadecimal
representation of clientID. All strings below are encrypted via AES256 and base64 encoding. The
HandlePP::getClientID method uses the following environment variables:

Figure 14. Randomly generated UUID

For the initial information packet, the backdoor also collects the following:

Figure 15. OS version

Running getpwuid ->pw_name , scutil – -get ComputerName, and uname –m will provide the
following returns respectively:

Mac OSX 10.12.

System Administrator

<owner’s name>’s iMac

x86_64

All these data are scrambled and encrypted before sending to the C&C server.  The process is
detailed below:

1. Scrambling

Class Parser has several methods, one for each variable type – Parser::inBytes, Parser::inByte,
Parser::inString, and Parser::inInt.

Figure 16. Parser::inBytes method

If clientID equals the following sequence of bytes B4 B1 47 BC 52 28 28 73 1F 1A 01 6B FA 72 C0
73, then the scrambled version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is treated as a
DWORD. Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with it, as shown in example below.

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


 Figure 17. Parser::inByte method

When scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even. If the
value is odd, it adds the byte, along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array. In the
case of an even value, the randomly generated byte is added first, followed by the byte being
added. In the case above, the third parameter is ‘1’ = 0x31, which is an odd number. This means
that it adds byte ‘1’ and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled array.

Figure 18. Parser::inString method

When scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence. First, it generates
one random byte, followed by three zero bytes, one random byte, and finally, the byte with the
length of the string. Let’s say we want to scramble string ‘Mac OSX 10.12.’ Its length is 13 = 0x0d,
and the two random bytes are 0xf3 and 0x92.  The final 5-byte sequence looks like F3 00 00 00 92
0D. The original string is then XOR’ed with the 5-byte sequence.

Figure 19. Scrambling ‘Mac OSX 10.12’

2. Encryption

The scrambled byte sequence is passed onto the constructor of the class Packet::Packet, which
creates a random AES256 key and encrypts the buffer with this key.

3. Encoding the encryption key

In order for the C&C server to decrypt the encrypted data, the randomly generated AES256 key

Convert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!

https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf
https://pdfmyurl.com/?src=pdf


must be included in the packet along with the encrypted data. However, this key is also scrambled
with operation XOR 0x13 followed by ROL 6 operation applied to each byte.

Figure 20. Function for scrambling AES256 key in the outgoing packet

Some screenshots taken during scrambling and encryption process:

Figure 25. Screenshot of the final payload to be sent to C&C server. The scrambled AES256 key
is marked green, while the encrypted computer info is marked red. Other bytes are just randomly

generated noise.

When the backdoor receives the response from the C&C server, the final payload needs to be
decoded again in a similar manner via decryption and scrambling. Packet::getData decrypts the
received payload and Converter::outString descrambles the result.

The received data from the C&C server include the following information:

HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css)

HandlePP::keyDecrypt

STRINGDATA::BROWSER_SESSION_ID (m_pixel_ratio)

STRINGDATA::RESOURCE_ID

These data will be later used in the C&C communication, as shown in the Wireshark screenshot
below.

Figure 26. Communication with the C&C server after the exchange of OS packet info

Meanwhile, the runHandle method of the main backdoor loop will call for the requestServer method
with the following backdoor commands (each command has one byte long code and is extracted
by Packet::getCommand):

Figure 27. The getCommand method

The figure below shows the example of two of several possible command codes. Both create one
thread, and each thread is responsible for either downloading and executing the file or running a
command line program in the terminal:

Mitigation

Malicious attacks targeting Mac devices are not as common as its counterparts, but the discovery
of this new MacOS backdoor that is presumably distributed via phishing email calls for every user
to adopt best practices for phishing attacks regardless of operating system.

End users can benefit from security solutions such as Trend Micro Home Security for Mac, which
provides comprehensive security and multi-device protection against cyberthreats.  Enterprises
