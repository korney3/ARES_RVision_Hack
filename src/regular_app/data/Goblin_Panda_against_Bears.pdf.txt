Goblin Panda against the Bears
During my last investigation (here), I’ve found two RTFs malware

documents with the same techniques of exploitation of CVE-2017–

11882:

A �le 8.t in %TMP% with Package Ole Object

The same loop of decryption

The same runPE after overwriting in memory EQNEDT32.exe

But the payload is really di�erent. It’s not a version of PlugX but a

version of Sis�der studied by Ncc group.

events/blogs/2018/june/cve-2017-8570-rtf-and-the-sisfader-rat/

With the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same

interactions with operating system than my last article and the paper of

NCC Group.

The di�erence with the version studied by NCC Group is the Package

Ole Object. In the article of NCC Group, the researchers talk about a

SCT File and many javascript manipulations for dropping the RAT on

the disk and to start it.

Here, the payload is encrypted in 8.t �le

If we analyze EQNEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, we

have the same technics anti emulation with the same value.

In a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah.

The veri�cation is calling GetMessage() and the value is stored in EAX

in the function sub_401A60.

The comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0.

Juste after we found again the loop of decryption for the con�g.

It’s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key.

The mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just

after dropping di�erents �les and a privilege escalation.

We found the same name of the dll �les.

The malware overwrite the comobject

{9BA05972-F6A8–11CF-A442–00A0C90A8F39} to execute when this

com object is called to make a persistence

All evidences show is the same payload Sisfader RAT.

The toolset for exploiting the module of equation is the same using of

the compromission for Vietnameses O�cials used by Goblin Panda.

If we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is

kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a real good pivot. It makes the link with

Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT.

And the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on

three IPs:

122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200

Theses addresses can permit to found others domains:

Sd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new

IP 1.188.233.201

The Ip Address 103.255.45.200 has two domains:

All infrastructure is based at Shanghai.

The victims are di�erent than the Vietnameses campaign.

They targeted Telecom Firms pretending to be the Intelligence Service

of Russia (FSB)

So Gobelin Panda targets like the report of CrowdStrike

https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-

266/images/ReportGlobalThreatIntelligence.pdf he telecom industries

in Russia.

Conclusion
Goblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian

with the same exploitation techniques for Vietnameses O�cials. They

updated theirs technics than the report of NCC group.
