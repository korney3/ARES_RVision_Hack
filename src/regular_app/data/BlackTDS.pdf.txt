Drive-by as a service: BlackTDS
MARCH 13, 2018 Kafeine

Overview

Proofpoint researchers have been tracking a new Traffic Distribution System called BlackTDS
implicated in the distribution of a variety of malware. BlackTDS is a privately held tool that has
been advertising its services on underground markets since the end of December 2017.

BlackTDS offers a variety of services to its clients that they collectively refer to as a “Cloud TDS.”
The operators claim that their Cloud TDS can handle social engineering and  redirection to
exploit kits (EKs) while preventing detection by bots -- namely researchers and sandoxes. Cloud
TDS also includes access to fresh domains with clean reputations over HTTPS if required.

The services offered by BlackTDS are summarized in their forum advertisements, the text of
which we have left unaltered:

“Cloacking antibot tds based on our non-abuse servers from $3 per day of work. You do not need
your own server to receive traffic. API for working with exploit packs and own solutions for
processing traffic for obtaining installations (FakeLandings). Dark web traffic ready-made
solutions. Placed in 1 click hidden code to use the injection in js on any landings, including on
hacked websites.” 
“Cost - $6 per day, $45 per 10 days, $90 per month, FREE place on our server, FREE hosting of
your file on green https:// domain. 3 DAYS FREE TEST” 
* Cloud Antibot Traffic Management System on our non-abuse servers 
* API for working with bundles of equities and custom solutions for processing traffic for obtaining



installations (Faklendings). Placing your file on a green https: // domain 
* Placed in 1 click hidden code to use the injection in js on any landings including on the shells

What we added during the holidays: 
* Built-in modes Iframe (a little morally outdated, but asked - we did). 
* fake Mirosoft update (breaks the page). 
* Fake update Jav and Fake update Flash (the page does not break, the original content is
visible). 
* uploading a file from your personal account to our server. 
* Configure delay for the appearance of fake windows. 
* Auto-download when clicking on the window area. 
* Updating the Black and Geo databases from 13.01.18. 
* increased by breaking through the downloads from 6%-12% to 10%-30%. 
* added detailed statistics on users who downloaded the file. 
* autostart file in fakes.

And this is only on holidays! We continue to work. Cloud TDS at your service

Threat actors drive traffic to BlackTDS via spam, malvertising, and other means, set up the
malware or EK API of their choice, and then allow the service to handle all other aspects of
malware distribution via drive-by.

Figure 2 shows a screen capture of the BlackTDS website that includes contact information,
localization, and recent updates.

We observed BlackTDS infection chains several times in the wild, distributing malware via fake
software updates and other social engineering schemes (Figures 3, 6-8).

Although identifying BlackTDS sites in the wild was relatively easy based on the presence of a
distinctive favicon (Figure 4), effectively associating the traffic with a known actor was difficult
and, in some cases, almost impossible.

ultimately redirected to Keitaro TDS and Grandsoft Exploit Kit

 

On February 19, we also observed a massive spam campaign from the actor TA505 with PDF
attachments containing links to a chain involving BlackTDS before ending on a website
purporting to sell discount pharmaceuticals. TA505 has typically distributed ransomware and
banking Trojans at enormous scale, making this particular campaign unusual.

It is worth noting that we determined which actor was operating the service itself based on an
artefact of this TDS since at least February 2017. We associate the artefact with a traffer we track
under the name “BBSindex”.

Figure 13 shows infection activity we associate with both BBSindex and BlackTDS:

appeared between February 12-19, 2017

BlackTDS runs on a single IP address that proved simple to track. However, at the end of
February, after being heavily flagged in many reputation services, the organization changed the
IP address.

Conclusion

Like so many legitimate services, we are increasingly observing malicious services offered “as a
Service.” In this case services include hosting and configuration of the components of a
sophisticated drive-by. The low cost, ease of access, and relatively anonymity of BlackTDS
reduce the barriers to entry to web-based malware distribution. With full support for social
engineering and the flexibility to either distribute malware directly or simply redirect victims to
exploit kit landing pages, BlackTDS demonstrates the continued maturation of crimeware as a
service. Moreover, it demonstrates that, despite their steady decline, EKs and web-based attacks
are not a thing of the past. On the contrary, web-based attack chains are increasingly
incorporating social engineering, taking advantage of both existing underlying infrastructure and
human fallibility rather than short-lived exploits.
