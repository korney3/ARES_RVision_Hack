Cyberespionage

Resecurity has shared the acquired intelligence with law enforcement and partners for
mitigation.

Friday, December 28, 2018 at 10:25 AM – Resecurity reached out to Citrix and shared an
early warning notification about a targeted attack and data breach. Based on the timing
and further dynamics, the attack was planned and organized specifically during Christmas
period.

The incident has been identified as a part of a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign
supported by nation-state due to strong targeting against government, military-industrial
complex, energy companies, financial institutions and large enterprises involved in critical
areas of economy.

Based our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques
and procedures (TTPs) allowing them to conduct a targeted network intrusion to access at
least 6 terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including e-mail
correspondence, files in network shares and other services used for project management
and procurement.

We forecast a continued growth of targeted cyber-attacks on supply chains of government
and large enterprises organized by state-actors and sophisticated cyberespionage groups.

Below are the indicators of IRIDIUM activity available for disclosure (for today). We will
update the list with new information once it becomes available.

We would like to thank the following organizations for their timely assistance and
collaboration regarding the malicious network activity during the Winter 2018 period: DHL,
NBC (National Bank of Canada), Skrill, PayPal and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.

(The list will be updated)

Updated (5:09 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)

The Global Access List (GAL) acquired as the result of password-spraying (on Citrix
employee accounts), which is a type of attack for brute-forcing and credential-stuffing,
includes 31,738 records. The threat actors leveraged it for further reconnaissance and
accounts compromise. Based on our analysis, one of these elevated actions was
conducted on Monday, October 15, 2018 at 1:57 AM.

Password-spraying was one of the most commonly used techniques by Mabna Institute
hackers and their associates during the early stage of the attacks to gain a foothold in the
victim’s environment. More information about their techniques is available in FBI Flash
Alert (ME-000092-TT):

Leveraging the initial group of compromised accounts, download the Global Address
List (GAL) from a target’s email client, and perform a larger password spray against
legitimate accounts.
Using the compromised access, malicious actors attempt to expand laterally (e.g.,
via Remote Desktop Protocol or other means) within the network, and perform mass
data exfiltration.

As a result, threat actors conducted network intrusion to access data in Citrix infrastructure
remotely.
